    content_html: "<p><em>In 2020, during the height of the pandemic and with lots of time on my hands, I developed a 15 pitch route that became Deep Blue. The slowness of the pandemic period quickly changed as life went back to normal and I added going to school for Computer Science on top of a full time job as a routesetting manager at Seattle Bouldering Project, and I never got around to writing up a story about this significant experience. </em></p>\n<p><em>I returned to Dolomite Tower last month to repeat Deep Blue and Vanishing Point after not climbing on the tower for two years. I was reminded how special that wall is to me and wanted to try to get some words down to remember it. Right now, the Bolt Creek Fire is still barely controlled and ravaging the south slope of Baring. I’m not sure how it’ll effect future experiences climbing on that wall. The descent trail goes right through the path of the fire and is likely a mess right now. It’ll likely take many hours of donated time to clean it up as it is an unmaintained trail. But hopefully putting this story out there will provide some motivation to keep it alive.</em></p>\n<p><em>Here is my story:</em></p>\n<p>Since climbing Vanishing Point in 2017 I had been dreaming about doing a new route on Dolomite Tower. I finally stirred up the psych to do it in 2020. We were living under Covid-19 lockdowns, so I had nothing better to do than swing around on a huge wall surprisingly close to Seattle.</p>\n<p>My first weekend on the Dolomite Tower I hiked to the top by myself. In a large haulbag I carried a 600ft static line, climbing gear, and bivy gear. It must have weighted over 70lbs, likely the heaviest load I had ever carried. The 4-hour slog up to the top of Dolomite Tower, up nearly 4 thousand feet, was torture. The padless waist straps of the haulbag left bruises. Once all that gear was up there though, I was psyched. I was good for a weekend of exploration and camping in a beautiful place.</p>\n<p  ></p>\n<h3>Deciding Where to Drop the Lines</h3>\n<p>As a professional routesetter, I designed artificial rock climbing experiences and I brought that design mentality to my process of finding and creating this new route. Where the route finished would be one of the most important parts of the experience. Should the last pitch be a crux or a cooldown? What should it be like to pull over the top of the mountain? Will it slowly slab out or will there be a defined switch from steep climbing to summit ledge? Will the route finish at the summit or off to the side? Deciding where the route would finish would also define where the rest of the route would climb.</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/Dolomite-Tower.jpeg'' alt=''Dolomite-Tower.jpeg''/><p>Deep Blue, Vanishing Point, and the BASE exit.</p></figure><p>After finishing the 4-hour slog, I immediately started hiking around the top of Dolomite Tower, looking for the right spot to start. Initially I was drawn to finishing the route at the BASE jumper exit: a diving board jutting out of the side of the tower. Climbing one last overhanging pitch and flopping over onto the ledge would definitely be memorable. I felt really excited about it, like this was it. But from the BASE exit, I noticed a bolt up and climber’s left. Was there another route I wasn’t aware of? I climbed up to see if there was an anchor above it. It turned out to be Vanishing Point’s anchor, which I had thought was further climber’s right.</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize that Vanishing Point finished so close to the summit of Dolomite Tower, even though I had climbed the route twice! I knew from looking at photos that I wanted to try to take my route straight down the center of the face, which would mean starting not too far climber’s left of the Vanishing Point topout. The BASE exit was to the right, which was not what I wanted. The climbing up to the BASE exit seemed wet and a little loose anyway. I walked up to the summit and peered over the lip. A easy looking steep blunt arete took you to a sharp topout with a wide area to rest and sort gear. The rock looked good and dry. Because it was at the top of the mountain there was no snow to melt onto the route, which was the case with the BASE exit. I knew that this was it.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-on-the-last-pitch-of-Deep-Blue.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-on-the-last-pitch-of-Deep-Blue.jpg''/><p>Jasna on the last pitch.</p></figure><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Blake-topping-out-Deep-Blue.jpeg'' alt=''HADLEY-Blake-topping-out-Deep-Blue.jpeg''/><p>Blake topping out the last pitch on my recent repeat of Deep Blue.</p></figure><h3>Discovering the Top 600 Feet</h3>\n<p>I fixed the 600 foot static and threw it over the edge. I started rapping straight down, putting in occasional protection and re-fixing the rope. The rock was very featured and it was easy to find a line. The top 250 feet followed a blunt arete—a pretty obvious feature to climb. Below that it turned to open face. I kept rapping straight down, still finding plenty of holds, until I was hanging out over a big roof. It was getting late and I didn’t want to rappel into mysterious territory and deal with climbing back over the roof, so I decided to call it for the day and head up. The climbing from above the roof to the summit—about 300 feet—was mostly enjoyable 5.10 face climbing with the occasional 5.11 boulder problem.</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-last-100-feet-of-Deep-Blue.jpeg'' alt=''HADLEY-last-100-feet-of-Deep-Blue.jpeg''/><p>Looking up at the last 300 feet of climbing on the blunt arete.</p></figure><p>That night I set up a solo open bivy in a quite idyllic place. I could see Mt. Index, the Index Town Walls, Mt. Rainier, Glacier Peak, and out to the Puget Sound. I was also not far from home. I could hear the comforting rumble of the train down in the Skykomish Valley as I fell asleep—a pleasant mix of being remote and alone but also in a familiar place.</p>\n<p>Rays of sunshine woke me up the following morning. I would rappel below the mysterious big roof today. I made myself coffee and oatmeal, enjoying the solitude of the morning. I lowered onto the face around 7am and quickly dropped several hundred feet. I lowered out the roof, finagling stoppers into small discontinuous cracks every 10-15 feet. I was worried about loose rock but was met with perfect small edges, sidepulls, and pockets. It was going to be a good pitch, and possibly the crux of the route, but there was still almost 1000 feet of rock below it.</p>\n<p>I placed a big stopper below the roof and lowered down another 200 feet through face holds, a bulge, and layback flake. Below the bottom of my line, the wall overhung slightly and the climbing seemed like it would be thin. Judging by how featured the rock was so far, I was pretty sure there would be holds, but I’d have to wait till the next weekend to find out.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-climbing-the-roof-pitch-on-Deep-Blue.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-climbing-the-roof-pitch-on-Deep-Blue.jpg''/><p>Jasna pulling over the big roof.</p></figure><h3>A Party on Dolomite Tower</h3>\n<p>The psych about Dolomite Tower somehow aligned that summer. Two other Washington climbers, Matt Carrol and Dan Kluskiewicz, decided to replace all the hardware on Vanishing Point, a classic nearly-1500 foot 5.12b, put up in 1998 by Brian Burdo. Climbing Vanishing Point in 2017 was what got me dreaming about a new route on the face. So my second weekend on the route, seven of us met up Saturday morning to hike to the top together—my friend Blake, my wife Liz, Dan, Matt, and two of their friends who volunteered to help schlep rope and hardware to the top of the tower.</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-looking-up-Dolomite-Tower.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-looking-up-Dolomite-Tower.jpg''/><p>Sea of rock with the small dots of Blake and Matt above.</p></figure><p>Blake and I hiked up another 400 feet of rope, which would allow us to get down to a big ledge one quarter of the way from the bottom. This was the only part of the wall that could stop the whole project in its tracks. If this section was climbable, we could commit to finishing the route. Below the ledge looked like easier climbing, and if it wasn’t, it would be possible to gain the ledge from the start of Vanishing Point.</p>\n<p>Blake would work on the top part of the route while I pushed the route further down. I once again dropped hundreds of feet down the wall, this time with a crowbar. I scared the shit out of myself by pulling off several human sized flakes. After reaching the bottom of the 600 foot static, I made an anchor, tied off the new static to it and continued down the wall.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, small holds continued to appear at regular intervals. I followed interesting features, connecting stances, while keeping the line relatively straight. Four hundred feet down from the end of last weekend’s low point and 1000 feet from the top, I landed on the big ledge. I knew the route would go.</p>\n<p>It took me over an hour to get through a 35 meter section of particularly hard climbing. I roughly figured out where I wanted to take it, but it seemed hard. It felt like that pitch would be at least 5.13. I’d have to leave it for the next weekend to figure out.</p>\n<p>Climbing 1000 feet in less than 3 hours with a backpack was punishing. I rarely feel like my fingers are giving out, but I did that day. It was hard to tell how good the climbing was through the intense pump brought on by the sustained small holds and overhung climbing.</p>\n<p>Blake hiked down that evening, leaving Liz, Dan, Matt, and I to enjoy the night on top of the tower. The next day I worked on the upper parts of the route alone, replacing the single stoppers with safe anchors and trundling any loose rock I could find.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-on-crux-pitch-of-Deep-Blue.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-on-crux-pitch-of-Deep-Blue.jpg''/><p>Jasna on the sporty overhang section of the crux pitch.</p></figure><h3>The Pitches Off the Ledge</h3><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-on-P7-Deep-Blue.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-on-P7-Deep-Blue.jpg''/><p>Jasna on P7 (5.12+).</p></figure><p>The next weekend, it was just Dan, Dan’s friend, and I. My plan was to figure out the crux pitch while also cleaning and prepping as much of the route down to the huge ledge at a quarter height as I could. I worked feverishly, getting an incredible amount of work done.</p>\n<p>The three pitches off the ledge surprised me with their quality. A 5.12- pitch, then a 5.12+, and then the crux, a 5.13, link some of the most consistently steep rock on the route. The 12- pitch leaves the big ledge with a couple boulders down low and then eases as it climbs into a pedestal feature. The 5.12+ pitch climbs through a roof and then onto a perfect vertical face with edges, slopers, and sidepulls. The 5.13 was a long pitch—35m—with three distinct sections, each with their own flavor: a sporty overhang, a bouldery undercling crack, and a slightly overhung thin and pumpy face to finished the pitch. It is a dream pitch with quality rock and movement the whole way.  </p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-on-upper-part-of-crux.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-on-upper-part-of-crux.jpg''/><p>Jasna executing the redpoint crux high on P8 (5.13).</p></figure><h3>The Pitches Below the Ledge</h3><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Luke-starting-first-pitch.jpeg'' alt=''HADLEY-Luke-starting-first-pitch.jpeg''/><p>My brother Luke starting P1 on my recent repeat of DP.</p></figure><p>I convinced my good friend Mike Kerzhner to come help me try to push the route to the base of the tower. The plan was to figure out an original line from the base of the tower to the big ledge. I had decided that I didn’t want to continue my trajectory straight down because the climbing did not look interesting. You’d have to claw your way up grassy ledges and tiptoe over piles of loose rock. From photos, I could see that there was a clean looking face just left of Vanishing Point. </p>\n<p>After completing the grueling hike to the top of Dolomite Tower yet again, Mike and I set up camp and racked up to drop in. We both rapped down to the ledge and Mike got to work cleaning the first pitch off the ledge. I fixed the ledge traverse and lowered into new terrain, following a subtle corner feature most of the way down until it disappeared into an overhung blank face. If I kept going straight down, the crux of the route would be getting off the ground! I thought that there might be a way around, so I started swinging out to the left. I found deep pockets and edges breaking through the blank face, leading to a good stance. The pitch wouldn’t be the crux, but it seemed like it would be one of the hardest (it ended up being around mid-5.12). I placed a bolt at the stance and rappelled straight down 15-20 meters to the ground. After several weeks of work, it was strange to finally touch the “ground”—still 2000 feet above Barclay Lake!</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Luke-Stefurak-on-P2.jpeg'' alt=''HADLEY-Luke-Stefurak-on-P2.jpeg''/><p>Luke Stefurak following P2 in the clouds during my 2020 redpoint ascent.</p></figure><p>Figuring out the bottom three pitches was on average more time consuming than the pitches above. It was the only time where I couldn’t keep going roughly straight down, which says something about how featured that wall is, or just my luck!</p>\n<p>We had to call it that first day with a lot of work remaining. Mike and I started slowly climbing the whole wall back up to our bivy at the top. We had stashed everything on the wall, so we were able to enjoy climbing light. I sent the crux pitch on toprope for the first time, feeling like the route was within my limits. It would be a hard route, but not too hard. At mid-5.13, it would be an achievable goal for many climbers in this era where climbing 5.13 quite common. </p>\n<p>The next day Mike and I finished the rest of the prep and cleaning work, and climbed the whole tower once more. After that weekend I took a break from the wall. I still had to do some work on the approach, lead the route, and remove the fixed lines.</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/Dolomite-Tower-approach-beta.jpeg'' alt=''Dolomite-Tower-approach-beta.jpeg''/><p>The complicated approach to Dolomite Tower.</p></figure><h3>Dumbing Down the Approach</h3>\n<p>A few weeks later, I teamed up with Luke Stefurak to work on the approach. We added rap anchors on the approach slabs so that they could be reversed and found a way around a portion that is a waterfall in the early season. A big mental aspect of climbing Vanishing Point before was feeling like you really didn’t want to reverse the approach. If you needed to bail, it seemed like it’d be better to bail upward. Now that’s not the case. Just turning around is safe and easy.</p><h3>Sending</h3><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Luke-sorting-out-crux.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Luke-sorting-out-crux.jpg''/><p>Luke sorting out the crux pitch on the day of the first ascent of Deep Blue.</p></figure><p>Luke came out again to support me on the first official ascent. We aligned our schedules with “the Matts,” who would climb Vanishing Point at the same time. One of the Matts, Matt Carrol, had put in a lot of work replacing the hardware on Vanishing Point that summer, without ever climbing the route ground up. Him and I were both going for “the send” on the routes that we had been swinging around on for several weeks already. We had the routes rehearsed, so the atmosphere was light, despite climbing in eerie clouds and wind all day.</p>\n<p>Luke and I hiked to the top so that we could rappel down and move the fixed lines out of the way. The Matts were approaching from the bottom. Near the bottom of the wall I realized I had left all our water at the top! Luckily the Matts, who were already on the wall, had some extra water and we were able to swing over near enough to them to grab it.</p>\n<p>It was really meaningful to finally enjoy the experience I had been working to create all summer. I felt good, and the climbing felt amazing. Both Matt and I sent our summer projects with no falls. Thank you Luke for supporting me on that day!</p><figure class=''left''><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-VP-from-Deep-Blue.jpeg'' alt=''HADLEY-VP-from-Deep-Blue.jpeg''/><p>One of the Matts belaying over on Vanishing Point. It was a cold but fun day!</p></figure><h3>Supporting Jasna and Removing the Fixed Lines</h3>\n<p>I left the fixed lines up, hoping that someone would make use of them to check out the wall with the remaining time that summer. Luke and Matt suggested that I reach out to Jasna Hodzic and see if she’d be interested in climbing the route. I talked to Jasna on the phone and coincidentally she had one last goal for the year: “a hard multipitch.” I gave her all the beta and the weather looked promising, so she decided to go for it.</p>\n<p>Jasna spent two days on the lines before deciding to give it a lead attempt. We got Luke, Matt, and I back together to support her. Unfortunately our day was one of the worst wildfire smoke days of the year. We knew it’d be incredibly unhealthy to go out in the mountains, but we decided to go for it anyway. We didn’t know the next time that the weather, schedules, and psych would come together.</p>\n<p>We all started from the bottom together at around 7am. Luke would do some more work on dumbing down the approach, reverse it, and hike to the top to help carry out ropes. Matt would belay Jasna, who would lead all the pitches, and I would continue ahead, pulling up the fixed lines and taking photos.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Matt-and-Jasna-on-P6.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Matt-and-Jasna-on-P6.jpg''/><p>Good vibes only on P6.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Jasna-sending-last-hard-pitch.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Jasna-sending-last-hard-pitch.jpg''/><p>Jasna sending the last hard pitch on her no-falls second ascent of Deep Blue.</p></figure><p>The day worked out beautifully. It was inspiring to watch Jasna send the whole route with no falls. Usually when you put up a new 5.13 multipitch, it might not get repeated for years. It was great that someone else got to share the experience only a couple weeks later. After topping out the route, Matt said something like, “I’m actually irked by how sick that was.”</p>\n<p>Luke was waiting for us at the top, literally hanging his head over the edge as we climbed the final pitch. As I was hauling a batch of four 60m ropes, he pulled out the 600ft line by hand! We were back at the cars at 10pm—15 hours car-to-car, a pretty standard Dolomite Tower day.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-Matt-topping-out-Deep-Blue.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-Matt-topping-out-Deep-Blue.jpg''/><p>Matt topping out Deep Blue on a very smoky day.</p></figure><h3>Note on the Name</h3>\n<p>On May 11, 1997, an IBM computer called Deep Blue beat the world chess champion after a six-game match: two wins for IBM, one for the champion and three draws. This event was a momentous step forward in artificial intelligence. Deep Blue was retired to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC.</p>",

    content_html: "<p>This writeup is a year late, but I wanted to make sure I had something down for this great 2021 trip to the Long’s Peak Diamond with my good friend Mike Kerzhner. If you like hard multipitch climbing in the mountains as much as I do, then a trip to the Diamond is essential. There is nothing like it in North America – a beautiful high elevation wall stacked with hard routes. That’s coming from someone who loves the rock walls of the Cascades more than any other range.</p>\n<p>After recently putting up Rubbernecker in the Washington Pass alpine, Washington now has a 5.14 alpine multipitch, and taken together with other routes like Backseat Driver, The Dark Side of Liberty, and Deep Blue – all mid to hard 5.13s – Washington definitely does not lack a legit collection of hard multipitch routes in the mountains. But the main thing Washington alpine multipitch climbing does not have is the elevation. The Washington alpine starts around six thousand feet and our alpine walls are generally starting at seven thousand. The Diamond starts nearly a mile higher! </p>\n<p>Going into a 10 day trip, there were two routes on the Diamond that I wanted to check out – The Honeymoon is Over (5.13c, 1000ft, 7 pitches) and the new route, Gambler’s Fallacy (5.13b, 1000ft, 9 pitches), which at the time hadn’t seen a second-ascent. I knew it might be ambitious to try for both of them in such a short window. </p>\n<p>First, Mike and I “warmed up” on Eroica (5.12b, 1000ft), which proved to be more then we bargained for! I was slammed by mild altitude sickness near the top of the wall and just wanted to lay down and take a nap. I was super fatigued and had a splitting headache but knew that the best thing I could do was to get down the mountain. Altitude can debilitate you, but to fix it you have to move! Down! Not lay down, though that’s absolutely the thing you want to do most. That first day was a 15 hour push. In the words of a sport climber, we got a little flash pumped (meaning, our chosen warmup was wayyy to hard and we suffered for our ambition). Climbing anything on this wall was serious. </p>\n<p>Day two on the Diamond, we hiked to the top of Long’s and dropped into The Honeymoon is Over (THIO) to work it out on toprope. THIO has three pitches of 5.13 in a row, which at the time, was one of the most sustained multipitch routes I’d tried. Each pitch has its own character. The first and the crux pitch, a 5.13c, is characterized by sustained and technical laybacking, compression, and bad feet. The second, a 5.13b, is composed of boulders split with good rests. And the last, a 5.13a, is pumpy and powerful, and just not that much easier than the other two 5.13s!</p>\n<p>Day three on the Diamond, we climbed THIO ground up. I sent leading every pitch, falling once on the 13c pitch. Mike sent the 13c and 13b pitches on TR, but was too exhausted from our cumulative efforts over the last 5 days to finish in good style. </p>\n<p>After three climbing days on the Diamond over a span of 5 days, we needed to rest. we spent the next four days relaxing by the river, sport climbing, scrambling on the Flatirons, reading, and hanging out with friends. I needed time to build psych to go back to the Diamond. And I knew I had only one day left for the Diamond, so I needed to make it count. My objective would be to climb the new route Gambler’s Fallacy (5.13b) ground-up in-a-day, which had yet to see a second ascent.</p>\n<p>Well, I lucked out, and after several hours of slowly inching my way up wet hand jams, kneebars, power laybacking, and insecure slab moves, I found myself at the top of Gambler’s Fallacy without falling once. A flashed second-ascent.</p>\n<p>Climbing something that hard in the alpine first try is an accomplishment I’m very proud of. I was able to translate climbing skills – learned in the gym routesetting, at the local crags, and while traveling – to this harsh high-elevation environment, where conditions certainly are not comfortable. To me, climbing a route like this in this style is the fullest expression of my climbing craft.</p>\n<p>Only 4 days on the Diamond, but that was all our 10 days and psych would allow! Certainly looking forward to making it back soon.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_9576.jpeg'' alt=''IMG_9576.jpeg''/><p>Approaching the Diamond in the early morning.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_9618.jpeg'' alt=''IMG_9618.jpeg''/><p>Mike questing up the fourth pitch of Gambler’s Fallacy.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_9640.jpeg'' alt=''IMG_9640.jpeg''/><p>Mike on the first 5.13 pitch of Gambler’s Fallacy.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_9650.jpeg'' alt=''IMG_9650.jpeg''/><p>Mike finding a no-hands rest on the second 5.13 pitch of Gambler’s Fallacy.</p></figure>",

Now he shares his passion for climbing through his work as the lead route setter at the <a href='https://seattleboulderingproject.com/'><strong>Seattle Bouldering Project in Fremont</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>And while he naturally possesses an analytical inclination, he draws upon his interests in other design disciplines to set routes that enable climbers with different skill levels to find inspiration, apply knowledge, and refine techniques.</p>\n<p>“What we’re trying to do is to create and curate experiences for other people to come in and enjoy,’ says Hadley. ‘The climbers coming into the gym, new climbers or experienced climbers. These are the people we’re focused on building these routes for.”</p>\n<p>Every day brings unique challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Each person on our team will design and build three to five boulder problems.”</p>\n<p>The process relies on an artistic inclination to draw lines, create shades, and experiment with white space in order to make an idea come alive on paper.</p>\n<p>“It’s similar to doodling,” Hadley explains. “Sometimes you discover what you’re trying to draw in the process of drawing.”</p>\n<p>But persistence and teamwork can lead to important discovery and insight.</p>\n<p>“That’s the part of the process that I really enjoy. You can have a rough idea in the morning of something that you want to set up. But when you put your climbing shoes on, you experience it – it’s almost like the boulder problem can communicate back to you, that there’s a certain kind of spirit there.”</p>\n<p>With a few tweaks and tests, it may even build towards a revelation that fully connects mind, heart, and community.</p>\n<p>“This is right,” Hadley smiles, when that magical moment happens. “This is what we needed here.”</p>",

    content_html: "<p>Ever since climbing Dolomite Tower, a subpeak of Mt. Baring, in 2017, I fell a little in love with that face. I hiked several of my friends and family out to Barclay Lake to show it off. The climbing on Vanishing Point, the one modern-ish route on the tower (put up in 1998 by Brian Burdo, and now fully modern thanks to 2020 efforts on it), is fun and the setting spectacular. Climbing it with my good friend Travis Kemp left an impression. I couldn’t forget it. And I wanted to experience it again or give back to the wall in some way that would encourage others to experience its magic as well.</p>\n<p>Climbing Vanishing Point is serious. The approach is very technical and hard to get right even with good information. The climbing on the tower is hard, sustained, exposed, and sometimes straight-up dangerous. Travis and I got really spooked on pitch 5, when we realized a whole part of the pitch had fallen off, taking with it a few bolts. It took us over an hour to figure out how to get around it. We went into survival mode after that and climbed quickly to the top of the wall. There were runouts, a death flake, and hanging belays. We enjoyed it, but it felt real. I was scared to shit but afterwards thought it was the coolest wall I had ever climbed.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the insane year of 2020. I didn’t have climbing plans for the summer when the lockdowns happened this spring. I realized that I might not be able to leave Washington State this year, so I decided to revisit Dolomite Tower, with a trailhead only 1.5 hours from my place in Seattle. I convinced my good friend Mike Kerzhner to drive up from Portland to climb Vanishing Point again. Memories can be deceptive, so I wanted to re-remember what it was like up there.</p><h3>Story of our June Climb</h3><p>Mike and I woke up in Seattle at 5am, June 19th, made coffee and started driving. We were leaving the Barclay Lake trailhead around 7am. The first 20 minutes of the approach is spent on a flat trail in a beautiful forest—a mental warmup for what you’re about to experience. After about a mile, you’ll have to thank the trail for what it’s given you and brake right. Thankfully, if the approach is done correctly, there is minimal bush-whacking. Mike and I pushed through bushes for a few minutes to gain a boulder field, crossed it, and entered a wash. The wash takes you up to a gaping gully, which you avoid by escaping right on a ramp into a steep forest. In June, Mike and I were kick stepping up snow to gain the ramp.</p>\n<p>Climbing the forest is my favorite part of the approach. If you’ve spent a lot of time on the walls in Squamish, you’ll feel right at home climbing up the jungle gym of tree roots. Brian Burdo, and probably other first ascensionists of Dolomite Tower and Mt. Baring routes, left behind several fixed lines to help haul yourself up the steep slope. They also serve as a nice guide. The ropes eventually take you up to a perch overlooking the gully and slabs that must be climbed to the base of the tower.</p>\n<p>Mike and I packed all of our water, but we felt really silly for doing that once entering the gully. For the rest of the approach, flowing water was always nearby. And this flowing water made approaching that day a mini-epic for us.</p>\n<p>We scrambled up the gully to approximately the spot where I remembered roping up and starting up a bolt-protected slab, but we couldn’t find the first bolt. We looked around for 20 minutes and still couldn’t find anything. I was starting to mentally prepare to turn around and bail. I roped up and started climbing up a slab that seemed to look right to see if a bolt would appear. It was wet and slippery, with no protection, so I didn’t make it very far before deciding to come back down. Mike thought a series of narrow ledges going out left looked promising. I knew that was not where the bolts would be, but I thought I might be able to protect it with gear. Right after I started out the ledges, Mike finally spotted the bolt we were looking for. It was in a waterfall right above us! It looked like the 2 pitches of bolted slab was completely running with water. There was no way we were going to make it through the runouts between bolts in a slabby waterfall, so I continued trying to find a way around. I ended up getting two pieces of gear in and slinging a finger’s width branch of a bush for about 200 feet of climbing. Not ideal.</p>\n<p>We made it up the rest of the approach slabs, which included climbing through another waterfall and once going the wrong way up unprotected wet dirt. I was hoping the approach would feel easy the second time but because of the early season water and snow, it took longer and felt much scarier. I have since been back with Luke Stefurak to fix up the approach pitches. We put in a handful of bolts to protect the easier alternative route up the slabs (avoiding the waterfall early-season), and we installed rap anchors so that climbers can reverse the approach safely. Luke and I foreran the approach reversal and it felt great. Because an easier section of slab is now protectable, it’s pretty reasonable to climb the whole thing in approach shoes, which is really good news for our feet.</p>\n<p>The climbing on Vanishing Point was mostly uneventful compared to the approach. The third runout was still scary, and the flare a little wet and desperate. We were able to easily climb around the section of roof that had fallen off on pitch 5. The eighth pitch was also still scary. The death flake on pitch 9 is still on the wall. By the time we got to the 5.12 pitch out the huge roof (pitch 11), we barely had enough left in the tank to get through it. Mike and I both didn’t fall, but we felt like we had to fight for it. We were 15 hours car-to-car, pretty reasonable if you’re trying to free climb every pitch. It’s a big climb.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-3.jpg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-3.jpg''/><p>Mike on the pitch 3 flare (5.11+).</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-6.jpg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-6.jpg''/><p>Pitch 6 (5.11+).</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-10.jpg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Pitch-10.jpg''/><p>Mike starting out the huge roof on pitch 10 (5.11).</p></figure><p>I had been on the route before so I was happy to send, but Mike onsighted, which hadn’t been done. I think we might have been the 3rd and 4th ascents of the route after Brian Burdo (FA, 1998) and Ben Gilkison (2012). I’m really curious if anyone else climbed it, let alone sent, between 1998 and 2012.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Vanishing Point 2.0</h3>\n<p>Vanishing Point was as good as I remembered but also scarier than I remembered. After climbing it again, I felt that certain decisions could be made to make it safe. Loose rock could be pulled off, sketchy flakes could be avoided (or pulled off!) and unnecessary runouts could be protected. The involved approach could be dumbed down as well. </p>\n<p>Overall the rock is really good, and I think it’s just a matter of mindset. We’re used to immaculate granite out here and Dolomite Tower definitely is not that. It’s more featured and overhung, and the cracks are few and far between. But the position and the interesting face climbing make it truly worthwhile. I feel strongly that it is a gem in Washington, if not the country. If the Dolomite Tower was actually in the Dolomites, I’m sure it’d be littered with amazing routes.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, through a group effort this summer, headed by Dan Kluskiewicz and Matt Corroll, Vanishing Point was modernized. Mike and I slipped in the last ascent of the “old” Vanishing Point experience. </p>\n<p>All the anchors have been replaced and the rest of the protection has been updated to stainless steel. Dan and Matt placed two bolts to protect the unnecessary runout on pitch 3. On pitches 9/10, they re-routed the route slightly to avoid the “death flake.” Now you don’t have to touch it at all. There was a lot of discussion about whether to add a bolt to the runout on pitch 8, but Dan and Matt decided against it. Maybe it’s for the better to not dumb the route down too much. Pitch 8 will remain a mental crux of the route, but a much more reasonable one compared to what used to be on pitch 3. </p>\n<p>The approach is much less committing too. Luke Stefurak and I took charge of making it safe and easier to follow. We updated the rap anchors and moved already existing fixed lines to better spots. A big mental aspect of climbing Vanishing Point before was feeling like you really didn’t want to reverse the approach. If you needed to bail, it seemed like it’d be better to bail upward. Now that’s not the case. Just turning around with a single 70m is safe. (We tried it!)</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Topo.jpeg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Vanishing-Point-Topo.jpeg''/><p>Vanishing Point topo.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Dolomite-Tower-Approach.jpeg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Dolomite-Tower-Approach.jpeg''/><p>Dolomite Tower approach overview.</p></figure><h3>Approach Beta</h3>\n<p>1. Start at the Barclay Lake trailhead.</p>\n<p>2. Hike main trail to a bridge across large creek (about 1 mile). The creek is dry mid-to-late summer. Don’t cross it.</p>\n<p>3. Before the main trail crosses the creek, break into forest to the right of a large boulder.</p>\n<p>4. Walk through forest (no trail) till it opens up then bushwhack a little to boulder field.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_8532.jpg'' alt=''IMG_8532.jpg''/><p>Looking back across the boulder field. The main trail is just in those trees.</p></figure><p>5. Traverse boulder field until under some large trees and a open wash should appear.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_090924.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_090924.jpg''/><p>Looking up the wash (photo Luke Stefurak).</p></figure><p>6. Climb wash to a steep, chossy, dirty waterfall. Climb around right side, staying out of bushes (exposed).</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P5520063.jpg'' alt=''P5520063.jpg''/><p>The dirty waterfall. It’s steeper than it looks.</p></figure><p>7. Continue up wash to a ramp which takes you up right into the forest before a gaping gully. There’s some hand lines on the ramp (exposed!).</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_8533.jpg'' alt=''IMG_8533.jpg''/><p>The ramp leaving the wash into the forested rib. The gaping gully is to the left.</p></figure><p>8. Batman up first steep rope in forest and then head hard right. You should end up at a small rock face with a bolt and fixed lines.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2020-HADLEY-Forested-Rib.jpg'' alt=''2020-HADLEY-Forested-Rib.jpg''/><p>Mike climbing up the first fixed line in the forest.</p></figure><p>9. Climb past bolt and head right again. Fixed lines then guide you the rest of the way to the top of the forest rib.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P5520074.jpg'' alt=''P5520074.jpg''/><p>Looking up at the slabs from the top of the forested rib. You must descend into the gully from here.</p></figure><p>10. Descend into gulley. Climb gulley up and over a low 5th step with a fixed line attached to a bolt.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_151604.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_151604.jpg''/><p>The low 5th step in the gully (photo Luke Stefurak).</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_8539.jpg'' alt=''IMG_8539.jpg''/><p>Looking down the gully from the top of the low 5th step. The top of the forested rib is in view.</p></figure><p>11. Continue up about 50m to where you need to rope up. You should see Burdo’s old bolt and a newer looking bolt to the left. Go left. Climbing straight up on Burdo’s old bolted slab line is possible late season (it’s a waterfall early season), but it’s harder and might require putting on climbing shoes!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200825104505085_COVER%7E2.jpg'' alt=''00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200825104505085_COVER%7E2.jpg''/><p>There is a bolt at the “X” now. Should be easy to spot from the gully (photo Luke Stefurak).</p></figure><p>12. Climb left on ledges 10-15m and then up/right at the 2nd bolt. Climb past a 3rd bolt to a rap anchor (35m).</p>\n<p>13. Continue up and right on easy slabs passing 3 bolts to a large ledge with a rap anchor (another 35m).</p>\n<p>14. Coil up some of the rope and traverse the ledge left till you’re beneath a gully on the left side. There’s an exposed section early on the traverse with a bolt.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_120338.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_120338.jpg''/><p>Near the end of the ledge walk, looking up at the next 3 pitches of climbing (photo Luke Stefurak).</p></figure><p>15. Start climbing below an old bolt. Climb past this bolt and up to a constriction with a rap anchor (30m). This constriction in the gulley is usually running with water.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_123503.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_123503.jpg''/><p>After the ledge traverse, this is the first of 3 pitches (photo Luke Stefurak). See the approach overview photo.</p></figure><p>16. Continue up right side of gully (natural pro) to another rap anchor (35m).</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_130228.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_130228.jpg''/><p>2nd pitch after from the ledge (photo Luke Stefurak).</p></figure><p>17. Climb past old bolts on the 5.9 crux of the approach and up to an old anchor with a newer bolt beside it (30m).</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_20200825_134820.jpg'' alt=''IMG_20200825_134820.jpg''/><p>3rd pitch from the ledge (photo Luke Stefurak). This is the crux of the approach and it’s maybe 5.9 and protected well, albeit with old bolts. I was very comfortable climbing the pitch in approach shoes.</p></figure><p>18. Unrope and scramble up and left to the base of the tower. Going left will lead you past some 4th class and an old Burdo anchor (maybe stay roped up for this option). Going straight (towards the wall) and then left will lead you to a a point where you can either climb dirt and trees or bushwhack around to the left to reach the base of the route. There’s broad ledge to relax on below the route. </p>\n<p>If you nail the approach with this excellent beta, it should take about 3 hours to get to the base of the tower. There’s broad ledge to relax on below the route. If you walk along the wall left of the start of Vanishing Point, you should be able to find running water through mid-July. </p>",

    content_html: "<p>A circuit is a group of boulders designed to create a certain experience. In a competition, a circuit of 4 or 5 boulders is designed to separate the competitors, find a ranking, and to produce an exciting show for spectators. In a climbing gym, a circuit usually represents a diverse group of boulders of approximately the same level or grade. Outside, there could be a “highball” (tall boulder) circuit or a “5-star” (classics) circuit, for example. A circuit could be anything.</p><p>Circuits were invented in the early 1900s in Fontainebleau, France, as a way to train for mountain climbing. Transportation to the mountains was not as quick and easy as it is now so the Parisian mountaineers needed a way to train locally. Problem was that they only had access to little boulders! Nobody “bouldered” like we do today—it was all about getting to the summits of high mountains back then. Climbing boulders was silly and pointless until someone discovered that they could be useful for training. They figured out that using a marked group of boulders, usually 40 to 60 in length, climbers could move through them and roughly replicate the sustained effort required to climb a mountain.</p><p>Bouldering has since evolved quite a bit and so have the ways and varieties of using circuits. Just like bouldering V-grades, circuits are a tool to guide climbers. But circuits have become obscure in favor of pushing grades. Circuits take a step back from grades and focus on the experience, and ask helpful and fun questions like: Are you well rounded across many styles? Do you have enough endurance? Can you just enjoy climbing for a moment without trying to achieve a certain grade?</p><p>I want to show you here how to maximize the use of the circuit tool. The creation of a circuit experience does not only belong to guidebook authors or routesetters. You are a co-creator. In this document I will specifically focus on how you can create and use circuits for your physical and mental training.</p><h3>Endurance Circuits</h3><p>This is where it all started: mountaineers needing to replicate the endurance effort of climbing a huge wall using a bunch of tiny boulders. The endurance circuit is the original circuit. For multipitch and big wall climbers, the benefits of doing endurance circuits are obvious. For sport climbing, endurance training, like strength and power, is an essential building block that can be trained year-round.</p><p>Endurance training improves you aerobic capacity, which for climbers means your ability to climb at a higher grade without getting “pumped.” This means you’ll spend less time in the “red zone,” the anaerobic ticking clock. When you’re in endurance zone, you can pretty much go forever.</p><p>Endurance circuits can be done in less than an hour with little to no warm up, like going out for a run. They provide similar benefits to running and other cardiovascular activities, but with the specificity to climbing. If you’re getting pumped training endurance, you’re no longer training endurance, but power-endurance. You should be climbing at a low intensity on boulders you never fall from. Start with 30 boulders and progress toward 50-60. You should be doing a boulder every 30-60 seconds. The shorter the rest time, the better. You should feel like you’re continuously moving, like going out for a run!</p><p>Use the Bouldering Project specific Circuit Assessment at the end of the document to estimate your endurance circuit. If you don’t climb at a Bouldering Project, take the grade you consistently climb in 1-2 tries and climb boulders in the 3-grade range 1 to 3 below. For example, if you consistently climb V4 in a couple tries, you’re endurance circuit is likely V0-2 or V1-3. If you usually climb V7 in a couple tries, try a V2-4 or V3-5 circuit. If you’re new to endurance training, you may have to go lower. If you are climbing the circuit properly, you should not accumulate a pump. At the end of the circuit, you should feel a bit fatigued, but not pumped. Error toward climbing easier boulders.</p><h3>Power-Endurance Circuits</h3><p>Power endurance (PE) is often what we feel to be lacking on a sport route. Our forearms feel like they are going to burst and sometimes we can’t even hold onto jugs! Training it extends the “ticking clock” I referred to earlier and improves your ability to deal with a pump.</p><p>PE is unique because unlike strength, power, and endurance, it can only be increased for a short amount of time before continuing to train it does close to nothing for you. The best way to deal with the PE problem long-term is actually to make holds feel better (strength training), the moves easier (power training), and to increase the level you can climb without starting to get pumped (endurance training). Because of this, I recommend training these three systems year-round, and only training PE when you really need it. It only takes a month of consistent PE training to reach a “peak.” When I know I’ll need PE for a competition, a climbing trip, or for the fall season climbing locally, I’ll do 3-4 weeks of training to ramp it back up. You can maintain peak PE for a bit, maybe 2-3 weeks, but after that it will naturally ebb and flow. It’s best to accept and roll with this natural rhythm.</p><p>There are many ways to train PE. Too many, in fact. I’ll focus here on two circuit-based methods. The first method looks pretty similar to the endurance circuit, but with harder boulders and a bit more rest. The grade range should have an upper limit of the grade you consistently climb in 1-2 tries. If you are a consistent V5 climber, climb a circuit of V3-V5. Your rest time should be about 1 minute between boulders. Once you hit 3 tries, move on. In total, you should climb 20-30 boulders.</p><p>The second method is an interval method that I created for my needs as a sport climber. I took the 4x4, a well-known training method, and adapted it into a circuit. Usually for a 4x4 you choose 4 different boulders that are sustained in nature (overhung and not cruxy), with minimal low-percentage moves (no dynos, no bad feet, no stabs to slots, etc.), and you rehearse them into submission. Then you climb them back-to-back with no rest. Take a rest for about as long as you were climbing (usually 2-3 minutes) and repeat. Basically you are attempting to isolate the physical by controlling for the mental and technical. Because of this, you get a great workout, and 4 sets is usually plenty because the intensity is so high.</p><p>I think 4x4s are great, but I prefer making a spray wall loop of 20-30 moves because I can control the variables even more and take rest between boulders out completely. When it comes to climbing on actual set boulders I prefer the method that I created because it targets mental, physical, and technical skills all at once, just like real rock climbing does. The goal is to climb a circuit of 20-30 boulders in chunks of 3 or 4 at a time. Rest time is exactly like a 4x4: no rest between boulders (chalk up only) and a rest equal to climbing time between sets (2-3 minutes). If you do it with a partner, you can use each other to time your rest. While your partner is climbing their 3 or 4 boulders, you rest and cheer them on. As soon as they are done, you start your next set. Because you’ll be moving through the whole gym or climbing area, you’ll end up on some slabs, sometimes climbing problems you’ve never seen, and sometimes trying low-percentage boulders with bad feet right at the start. So you’re going to fall. Before you start, decide if you’re going to allow yourself 1 to 3 tries per boulder. I find it best to allow up to 3 attempts if the move you fall on is low to the ground. If I fall near the top of the boulder and felt like it was a good attempt, then I’ll move on. Because the physical intensity varies with the change in wall angles, you can do more sets than you would with a 4x4, up to 10, but generally around 5 to 8.</p><p>I can’t stress how important it is to value developing mental and technical skills in your training. Climbing is a skill-based sport more than it is physically requiring, even though it feels very physically requiring (it’s a trick!). That’s one reason we find it so fun: because of how varied its requirements are. The reality of outdoor (and modern competition climbing) is that there are awkward moves and weird feet. You need to be able to make quick and confident decisions when your body is screaming at you to let go. With either of these methods of PE circuiting, the question is equally about whether you can keep it together on the slabs, through the complex sequences, and across all climbing styles as it is about holding on. Sounds like rock climbing, right?</p><h3>One-Shot Circuit</h3><p>The one-shot circuit shifts the focus even more from physical to mental. Can you perform on the spot with only “one-shot?” Can you quickly respond to what the boulder requires of you? If not, then sorry, attempt wasted. You don’t get another.</p><p>I love the one-shot circuit because it feels like you’re putting something on the line with the 1-attempt limit. Its playful. It forces you to slow down and ponder the boulder before getting on it. What will be required? How does it climb? At what sections will I have to apply more foot pressure? When will I have to try really hard?</p><p>Visualization is a helpful tool when it comes to performing on the spot. It is best to imagine yourself in the first person (not third), and try to replicate how you’ll feel as closely as possible. What parts of your body will tense up? What emotions will you feel? Try moving your body and arms on the ground in the way you think you’ll have to move through the boulder. If you’re climbing with a partner, talk through the boulder with them before getting on it. The more details you can recreate in your mind, the better. And imagine success! I’m not encouraging over-confidence, but if you don’t actually believe you can do something, you’re chances of doing it are low. Be realistically optimistic. Many people ask me what you do if you’re wrong about how a route will feel or go. The answer is you adjust on the fly: make a quick decision and execute. This intuitive skill only comes from experience. So climb more and in new situations often.</p><p>The ideal one-shot circuit will contain boulders a notch higher than your power endurance circuit. So if you consistently climb V4 in a couple goes, climb a circuit comprised of V3-V5s. You might get a gimme here and there, but you should have to fight for most of your sends. You will fall, a lot. It’s OK if you’re success rate is less than 50%. Your rest time can be as long as you need, but will likely be between 2-5 minutes. You shouldn’t get pumped because you want to be able to perform at your best for every boulder. You’ll probably want to attempt around 20-30 boulders.</p><h3>Limit Circuit</h3><p>With this last circuit we’ll have spanned everything you need to train to become a better climber. A limit circuit is just a structured way to project and try a group of hard boulders. The purpose is to try, and fail, on hard moves. The limit circuit could be done at your <br>“redpoint circuit” or “project circuit” levels (see Circuit Assessment at the end of the article). You should attempt 5-10 boulders and attempt each 3-5 times. Because you will only climb a handful or so of boulders, you can focus on wall angles, climbing styles, or hold types that you need to work on. You could create a hard slab circuit, a dyno circuit or a sloper circuit.</p><p>This limit effort is the key to building strength and power. Strength refers to our ability to hold on to a hold and can be specifically trained on the hangboard. But targeting weaknesses like crimps or slopers through bouldering is possibly just as effective because of the additional movement skills you will pick up by doing real climbing. Just try hard boulders with the hold type you are weak at. Power refers to our ability to move between holds. The only way to effectively train power is by…moving between holds. This is bouldering. Overall, it is more beneficial to train strength and power through bouldering than by doing off-the-wall exercise like weighted pull-ups, hangboarding, and campusing. For very high level athletes looking for small gains, these exercise can be important, but for the rest of us, it’s probably better to spend our limited time climbing.</p><p>To conclude, I have attempted to give general guidelines and loose boundaries to create your own circuit experience. Below is a Bouldering Project specific Circuit Assessment that can be easily adapted to other gyms. Simply circle the percentage range of boulders you can climb within a given circuit and check the key at the bottom. Be creative, use your intuition, and have fun!</p><a href=''/assets/Circuit-Assessment.pdf''><p>Circuit Assessment PDF</p></a>",

    content_html: "<p>Mikey Schafer, with his partner Shanjean Lee, established yet another free line on the east face of Liberty Bell this summer. Their new route, “Dark Side of Liberty,” an 11-pitch, 350 meter 5.13d, is Mikey’s hardest new route to-date and is now Washington’s hardest multipitch route. So the route is hard, but it is also really, really good. The climbing on it is ridiculously fun, shocking sometimes in its quality.</p>\n<p>Mikey and SJ spent a chunk of the last two summers working on the route. I kept hearing about how cool it was, that an improbable steep section of Liberty Bell was shaping up to be quite promising. There is not much, if any, room left on the east face for completely new routes. Their’s might be the last. The line goes for some undeveloped orange, choosy-looking rock of the far right side of the face, right before it turns to the slabby north side. The first four pitches, characterized mostly by face climbing with some gear here and there, are the hardest. The rock on these pitches is impeccable, with some of the coolest granite holds I’ve ever touched. Pitch 2, the best pitch on the route, is a wonderful sustained adventure through edges, crystal pinches, a roof, compression slopers, a lip traverse, and more…</p>\n<p>The crux pitch, pitch 4, starts out with some cool 5.12 bouldering into nice, 5.12- fingers in a small corner. A good jug allows you to recover for a thin tech V9/10 boulder, immediately followed by a powerful V5/6 prow boulder. And since we''re on Liberty Bell, it’s capped with a final, no-hands slab stand-up move. The difficulty of the crux definitely stands out, and it’s possible the route would be better if it wasn’t as hard there, but the quality of the pitch I think is still quite good and it would be easy to pull through the hardest section if you wanted to climb the route at 5.13a A0. </p>\n<p>The upper 5.11 pitches are a nice contrast, taking mostly gear. A couple pitches need some traffic to clean up a bit more, but are still quite nice. </p>\n<p>I spent one day working out the first four pitches and came back the following week to try to send the route. It took me three tries to send the first pitch (5.12d), which I had onsighted my first day on it. It wasn’t a great start. I sent the second pitch (5.13a) first go, which probably doesn’t have a move as hard as the first pitch, but is overall much more sustained. At the crux fourth pitch, I fell a third time that day on the last move of the boulder, but was able to send second-go. I was able to onsight the final seven pitches, though the 5.11 pitches are not gimmes. The route did not go down without a fight. After climbing the Canadian Rockies Trilogy just a few weeks earlier, I’d say that the difficulty of the Dark Side of Liberty is right up there with these routes. The quality certainly is.</p>\n<p>Mikey already has a great topo posted on Mountain Project with good pitch-by-pitch descriptions. Congratulations Mikey and SJ, and thank you for the great contribution to Washington climbing! </p>\n<p>Austin Siadak took the few photos below, except for the last one, which I took. Thanks Austin for letting me post these here!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_7529.JPG'' alt=''IMG_7529.JPG''/><p>Mikey working through sculpted crystal pinches on the amazing 2nd pitch.

    content_html: "p>Mike Kerzhner and I started our four week stay in Canmore with a stop at the Bugaboos. Neither of us had been and we thought a little dose of alpine climbing would make us thankful for the Canmore bolted limestone. Mike and I met in El Chaltén, so it would be fun to check out this “mini-Patagonia” together.</p>\n<p>Mike drove up from Portland and picked me up in Seattle. On the drive we discussed our options. We could try one of the harder free lines on the easily accessible Snowpatch Spire’s east face. Or we could try to link a few moderates and get a tour of the area. Or we could go all in on All Along the Watchtower, a remote and long climb on North Howser Tower. All Along the Watchtower was the first climb I knew about in the Bugaboos, listed in<em>Fifty Favorite Climbs</em>. I’d looked at it for years, and was naturally drawn to doing it. It seemed to be the Bugaboos classic big objective.</p>\n<p>After spending a night in the truck, we finished the drive, taking the longest of dirt roads to the trailhead. It had been raining all morning and we were hoping to make the six hour approach to East Creek Basin that day to be set up to climb the Watchtower. The rain didn’t let up and we didn’t feel like slogging through it for several hours, so we decided to adjust our plans. No Watchtower this time.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-2.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-2.jpg''/><p>Kain Hut (bottom left) from Applebee Camp</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-1.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-1.jpg''/><p>Applebee Camp</p></figure><p>We waited out the rain and made the three hour approach to Applebee Campground, the main climber’s bivy. The next day we’d try a reasonable link-up of two classics—the Northeast Ridge of Bugaboo Spire and the Becky-Chouinard on South Howser. Several parties have climbed these two routes plus a few more all in a day, so our plan didn’t feel like it would be that ambitious.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at camp and finding a spot amongst the hundred or so other climbers camped there, we discovered we were walking into a long overdue opening in the weather. We also head that the rain had fallen as a foot of snow higher up. Having never been there we weren’t sure how to take in all the information and adjust our objectives. But I figured starting with an easy classic would be a safe bet. We could deal with some snow if there was any on Bugaboo Spire. And we didn’t have to link into South Howser if conditions were slow.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-5.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-5.jpg''/></figure><p>We set our alarms for 4am and were hiking by 5am. Sure enough, the NE Ridge of Bugaboo Spire was wet and covered in snow, pretty much in winter condition. I took the first block, simuling through the 5.7-5.9 pitches low on the route. Mike took over but we quickly realized he was out of his element, attempting to lead snowy low-fifth in a pair of downturned Scarpa Instincts. I took back the lead and took us to the summit which involved lots of tromping through snow in rock shoes, digging out handholds, and skooching across snowy knife-edge ridge.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-7.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-7.jpg''/><p>Pigeon Spire and the Howser Towers</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-9.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-9.jpg''/><p>Me rappelling from the summit of Bugaboo Spire</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-10.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-10.jpg''/><p>Descending the Kain Route on Bugaboo</p></figure><p>We didn’t stay on the summit long because we were just standing around in a bunch of snow. We did a few weird rappels and made it down most of the Kain route until we got to a dry spot to have a snack and decide what to do next. Even though it was still morning, attempting to climb South Howser in these conditions seemed a little more alpine than we wanted. We ran into some climbers who had checked out a popular climb called Surfs Up on Snowpatch but bailed because it looked too wet. We took a photo of their topo and decided to go have a look ourselves, hoping it had dried out a little in the sun since they looked at it.</p>\n<p>We made the short and easy walk across the glacier to the base of the route and stared up at it in indecision. Snow and ice was occasionally falling off the route. It started in a wet and snowy looking corner, which wasn’t inspiring, but we had nothing else to do with our day. It was only noon. The route was only “5.9” so we were sure we could probably still get up it wet. The first few pitches turned out to be more than we bargained for. Where the route usually climbs was snow and ice so we had to climb to the left through wet and mossy disjointed cracks with weird protection. Mike had to lead through a waterfall. We creeped through these pitches though and made it to dry splitter cracks that quickly and enjoyably took us to the summit of Snowpatch.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-11.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-11.jpg''/><p>Mike on the 2nd pitch of Surfs Up</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-12.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-12.jpg''/><p>Looking from the summit of Snowpatch over at Bugaboo Spire</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-13.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-13.jpg''/><p>Mike getting ready to descend Snowpatch</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-14.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-14.jpg''/><p>Mike on the first rappel down Snowpatch</p></figure><p>We enjoyed the views and looked across the way at Bugaboo Spire, relishing the fact that we had been standing on it earlier that day. After a snack we went down the normal rappels which follow a huge corner system. It was a trap for snow and water, and the whole thing was a giant waterfall. Exciting! Luckily it was still in the sun and we were able to stay warm.</p>\n<p>The next day we chose a shorter objective—the classic Sunshine Crack on Snowpatch—so we could hike out and make the 3.5 hour drive to Canmore at a decent time. The approach is an easy 45 minute jaunt across the glacier from Applebee. At the base of the climb we met two Chilean climbers who only had one 60m rope and needed another party to climb with them so that they could get down. I made a deal with them that if they let us go first we would rappel the route with them.</p>\n<p>The first few pitches were wet, including an offwidth waterfall. The upper two thirds of the route was dry though and the climbing was amazing—one of the highest quality mostly 5.10 routes I have ever climbed. We set the pace and our Chilean friends kept up. We descended together and Mike and I booked our way out of the Bugaboos. It had been a fun couple days of climbing in one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-15.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-15.jpg''/><p>The Chileans on the last pitch of Sunshine Crack (photo Mike)</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-3.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-BUGABOOS-3.jpg''/><p>Snowpatch Spire</p></figure>",

    content_html: "p>Mike and I both sent Blue Jean Direct on Mt. Yamnuska last Wednesday, our second day on the route. Blue Jeans has become a somewhat well-known hard multipitch route, one I’ve known about and wanted to do for a while. When it first went up at 5.13b, 7 pitches, in 2010, it was the hardest multipitch route in the Canadian Rockies. Since then, a handful of harder routes have gone up, including Sonnie Trotter’s variation of Blue Jeans, “Blue Jeans Direct.” Sonnie’s variation replaces the 5th pitch of Blue Jeans with a harder, more direct variation. It’s a short pitch that basically dumbs down to a fun V9/10 boulder through an overhang. Sonnie called it 5.14a.</p>\n<p>The whole route is pretty sustained. The pitches break down at 5.12b, 5.12d, 5.12d, 5.13b, 5.14a, 5.12a, and 5.10d. Yamnuska is south-facing and lower elevation relative to the other walls we’d been on, so the heat presented a challenge. We had to hike to the base of the wall in the blazing sun and climb the first few pitches before the route went into the shade around 5pm. The sun plus the difficulty of the pitches leading to the crux zapped us on our first day on the route. We needed full strength for the powerful crux, and by the time we had figured out what to do, we were too tired to give it any good attempts.</p>\n<p>On our second day we were able to get to the crux a little more fresh, despite the beach vacation sunshine on the lower pitches. The conditions were a bit better than last time though, with a slight breeze. And we were in the shade by then. We were both wearing shorts too, which was probably the ticket.</p>\n<p>We both fell on our first attempts. The boulder, the way we were figured it out, was super dynamic and powerful, like a Moonboard problem. The holds were all positive, usually with good thumbs, but they were all sideways and far apart. It was super fun to try. After getting the power turned ON, we both sent on our second attempt. The climbing to the top is mostly easy and we were over the lip of Yamnuska at 8pm, seven hours after leaving the car, in time to catch the last rays of sunshine.</p>\n<p>It was sort of an anti-climactic moment, finishing my dream Canadian Rockies ticklist of Castles in the Sky (5.14a, 5 pitches), The Shining Uncut (5.14a, 9 pitches), The Path (5.14a R trad), and Blue Jeans Direct (5.14a, 7 pitches). It had been exactly two weeks since getting on Castles for the first time. I didn’t think that my four week trip would be enough time for just two of these routes. Yet they all ended up being easier than expected, maybe partially because I was performing on a whole new level. I was prepared and totally in my element.</p>\n<p>My suspicion is that none of these routes present pure 5.14 physical difficulties. But each of them have a difficult mental element. I’ve wondered if this should be factored in or not in grades. Traditionally the mental/technical side of things has been downplayed. That’s why slabs are so hard. And one would expect to climb well below your limit in the mountains because of all of the other added factors like the approach, loose rock, exposure, uncomfortable belays, and logistics. The cumulative mental and physical fatigue of being “on” all day takes a serious toll on performance. Regardless of grade, these routes are all badass routes, and success on any of them is a huge accomplishment.</p>\n<h3>Beta</h3>\n<p>Blue Jeans is the easiest logistically of the Canadian Rockies Alpine Trilogy. The Yamnuska guidebook contains all the beta for the route and the approach. </p><p>We were climbing on the route early August, and the route was in the shade by 4:30 or 5pm. We started climbing around 2pm both days on the route. The lower pitches are doable in the sun, but the slippery rock on the first pitch was a bit rough.</p>",

    content_html: "<p>“The Path,” at Lake Louise, Banff National Park, is one of those iconic lines in North America that I have known about for a long time. The climbing on the beautiful 45 meter face looked excellent and the backdrop of Lake Louise provided a setting hard to beat. It’s become a test for those who want to push themselves on gear, but seemed ultimately safe. All ingredients for a classic rock climb.</p>\n<p>It was bolted back in the 80s, but had not seen an ascent until Sonnie Totter got to it in 2007. After inspecting the route, he found that it could be lead safely on gear, although with considerable distance between pieces at times. So he chopped the bolts and climbed the line naturally, rating it 5.14a R.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t thought much about attempting The Path until I made plans to spend four weeks in the Canadian Rockies to attempt some of the classic hard multipitch routes. After giving it more thought, I realized that getting on The Path should be a priority. It had all of those good ingredients and it also seemed like it would suit my strengths well. </p>\n<p>After climbing Castles in the Sky (5.14a, 7 pitches) on Castle Mountain and The Shining Uncut (5.14a, 9 pitches) on Mt. Louis, in only two days of work each, I needed a break to recover from putting in multiple long days in the mountains. Mike Kerzhner and I planned to spend a few casual days checking out Acephale, Cougar Canyon, and Lake Louise, some of the best crags in the area. Going to Lake Louise, our intention was to just toprope The Path a couple times, figure out how much of a project it would be and come back to it later.</p>\n<p>We arrived at Lake Louise at 7am on a holiday weekend, just in time to get one of the last parking spots. After getting some coffee at the hotel, we went straight to The Path and set up a toprope. The first half of The Path is one of the most popular 5.11s in the area, so we had to stake it out early. On my first toprope attempt I was surprised to find that it didn’t feel that bad. The gear seemed good and it climbed really well. Maybe it wouldn’t be as much as a project as we thought. I decided that I’d try to see how far I could get on my second toprope attempt and ended up getting to the top without falling! I didn’t expect to give it an attempt on lead that day, but that was the next step! Mike and I talked through the gear and were pretty satisfied with our selection. It was time to go for it!</p>\n<p>I was nervous and scared though, and unsure of my beta at the first crux, peeled off. The gear held and I pulled back on. I took another fall at the redpoint crux on a Black Diamond red X4, one of the smallest cams available. It held too. I needed to get all the jitters out and get used to the feeling of being runout over small gear. After taking some falls, I knew I was safe. I thought I had one more attempt in me. </p>\n<p>Our friend Ycbrand Nusse jugged up a nearby line to take photos and I started off on my second lead attempt, fourth attempt that day. I felt relaxed but a bit tired. At the first crux I struggled to get some gear in, but stayed calm and made it through. I recovered well at the next rest, confident that I would at least make it to the redpoint crux. The redpoint crux was not that hard for me though—I just needed to be confident and execute. Iron cross to the bad crimp, bring the left foot out, cross to the slippery bad crimp, and grab the good hold. I did exactly that. I enjoyed the last bit of runout climbing to the anchors in disbelief. I had just sent The Path in a day! </p>\n<p>If The Path really is 5.14, it would be my first 5.14 in a day. I don’t think it’s physical difficulties are 5.14, maybe just 5.13d, but if the mental element is factored in, maybe it deserves 5.14a.</p>\n<p>I was not even halfway through our four week trip and had ticked three of my four Canadian Rockies life list routes. I thought if I was lucky, I’d send just one or two! This trip has been a dream. I’ve been truly in my element!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-YCBRAND-NUSSE-NATHAN-HADLEY-ON-THE-PATH-1.jpg'' alt=''2019-YCBRAND-NUSSE-NATHAN-HADLEY-ON-THE-PATH-1.jpg''/></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset.jpeg''/></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-YCBRAND-NUSSE-NATHAN-HADLEY-ON-THE-PATH-4.jpg'' alt=''2019-YCBRAND-NUSSE-NATHAN-HADLEY-ON-THE-PATH-4.jpg''/></figure>",

    content_html: "<p>Wow. What a route. More than I expected. The Shining Uncut will live on as one of the best climbs of my life. It had all the elements of a great climb. A big beautiful mountain. A straight line up the center of the biggest face. Challenging and sustained climbing. Good to the very end.</p>\n<p>One day of rest after Castles in the Sky and Mike Kerzhner and I went straight to the next project: The Shining Uncut on Mt. Louis. In 2011, Tommy Caldwell and Sonnie Trotter, in an epic effort, put up The Shining ground up, bolting on-lead. They returned to free it and called it 5.13+. In 2017, Sonnie came back and linked three of the hardest pitches in order to skip the hanging belays. The mega 90m ledge-to-ledge pitch variation he called “The Shining Uncut,” 5.14a, and would be a third piece to his “Canadian Alpine Trilogy.” Mike and I had our eyes on the trilogy, though we didn’t feel like we needed to repeat it in exactly the same way. The three routes just looked like quality hard routes in the mountains. So far I had made quick work of Castles in the Sky (5.14a). Sonnie’s trilogy version of Castles in the Sky, “War Hammer,”  involved adding a bunch of low fifth to 5.11 climbing to take it to a summit, something we weren’t inspired to try. I was curious to try the Uncut version of The Shining though. It seemed like an appropriate challenge, and it’s usually nice to go ledge-to-ledge, one of the main reasons being that it’s more comfortable for the belayer!</p>\n<p>We spent our first day working on the 90 meter “5.14a” crux pitch on a fixed line. It seemed close and Mike and I returned after a rest day optimistic about sending. On our first attempts, we both fell at about the same point—at about 75 meters! That’s a lot of climbing to do only just to fall! He messed up his sequence and I missed a good foot. Even though it would be a long shot, we thought it could go second try if every move was executed perfectly. On my second try, I climbed through some rain lower on the pitch, hoping to not slip on a wet foothold. The rain thankfully stopped and I fought from teetering off the crux. When I made it to the anchors, I couldn’t believe it! Trying to stand on tiny feet and hold on to small holds with almost 90 meters of rope weight was quite the mental challenge. I thought I was off multiple times. Sometimes you just keep holding on! The feeling of pushing that hard in that situation high on Mt. Louis was powerful! It was a perfect challenge. </p>\n<p>After sending, I made two 45 meter rappels back down to the belay to give Mike another lead attempt. His foot slipped low and he decided to try the unlinked original version of The Shining. I jumared up to the hanging belay below the 5.13 crux pitch and Mike sent!</p>\n<p>We were both sending a version of the route. At that point it was almost 6pm. We had started hiking 12 hours ago. And we had some serious climbing to go. A 5.12 pitch, a long 12+, a rappel behind the Diamond flake, and a long 11+ to the summit was all. But we were low on daylight and water—we had dropped a bottle and spilled another in our haul bag! We were onsighting at this point and really did not want to have to retry a pitch. Climbing 5.12 in the mountains is not like climbing 5.12 at the crag! After I lead the first 5.12, Mike made a heroic lead up the 50 meter 12+ pitch to the top of the flake. This pitch was steep and follows an amazing crack that splits the top of the headwall. At the top of the Diamond, which is actually a massive flake separated from the mountain (see photos), we made a wild rappel into a chasm between the Diamond and Mt. Louis. One fun long 5.11+ pitch out of the ice box (literally!) took us to a belay just below the summit.</p>\n<p>The summit views at dusk were wonderful. Almost no wind. Perfect visibility.</p>\n<p>We finished the rappels in the light, down-scrambled by headlamp and hiked back to the car by 1am. What a day! A classic mountain adventure.More photos below…</p>\n<h3>Beta</h3>\n<p>Linking the first three pitches on the Diamond for the “Uncut” requires some logistics. I’m not sure how Sonnie Trotter did it. Sasha DiGiulian and Mike Doyle both climbed it with two 80s, ditching one partway up. But to climb it with an 80, you have to belay 10 meters above the main ledge on a smaller ledge, and even then the climber supposedly can barely clip the anchors. I climbed it with a 90m rope (the 8.5mm Beal Opera), and if you can get your hands on one, I think it’s the way (just don’t take too many whips on it!!). The belayer could comfortably stay on the main ledge with a 90. I did not climb with two ropes but chose to thoughtfully extend close to half of the draws. Many single extensions, a few double and one triple extension on the P2 anchor straightened it out pretty well. I wish I had an accurate draw count, but because most of the draws were already hanging (someone was working it already), I can only guess. You probably want 20 long draws and maybe another 15 regular. Honestly just bring all the long draws you can summon…you’ll be psyched. I was worried that trying the Uncut would be more annoying than fun, but I felt like it was a cool challenge. The rope drag with all the long draws was acceptable and dealing with mainly rope weight added an exciting element. Plus the hanging belay before the thirdpitch sucks. But ultimately it’s about what’s inspiring to you.</p><p>Follow approach beta for the Kain Route and continue past it to the prominent gulley. Scramble up the right side of the gully, staying left. You should see single bolt rappels regularly. The last bit is steeper and can be climbed/simuled in a single pitch with a few cams to the belay at the base of the Diamond.</p><p>You can rappel the route from the summit with a tag line. This is probably easier/faster/simpler then taking the normal descent for Mt. Louis. Use your tag line to pull yourself back across the chasm between the flake and the mountain. Thank you Sonnie Trotter and Tommy Caldwell for this amazing route put up in the best style!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-HADLEY-THE-SHINING-1.jpg'' alt=''2019-HADLEY-THE-SHINING-1.jpg''/><p>Mike approaching Mt.

    content_html: "<p>Last week I climbed Sonnie Trotter’s “Castles in the Sky,” a 5-pitch route on the middle tier of Castle Mountain. The crux pith is an epic 50 meter 5.14a, culminating on a beautiful sharp arête. I can’t emphasize enough how absurd the position is—you won’t be able to tell from the photos. And despite the still crumbling rock, the climbing is mostly solid, varied, and quite enjoyable. It’s easily one of my favorite pitches.</p>\n<p>Mike Kerzhner and I spent our first two climbing days in Canmore on Castles. Our 4-week trip was inspired mainly to come try this route. Sure, there seemed to be some great sport climbing at now well-known crags like Acephale and Planet X and other great looking multipitch routes like “The Shining” and “Blue Jeans,” but Castles in the Sky was the one route I was most psyched to try. It’s been on a mental ticklist for a few years now.</p>\n<p>I knew it’d be possible to send quickly, but I was prepared to spend most of the trip working on it. On our first day I made a pretty good first attempt, making it to the first real crux, but was flash pumped. The approach pitches were only 5.10 and I was pretty poorly warmed up. I wasn’t able to recover from my first attempt and fell lower on my second, still feeling pumped and fatigued from the altitude and the hike. It was a little demoralizing how hard everything felt. I worked out the moves well-enough though and just hoped that with some rest and a proper warm-up I’d feel much better.</p>\n<p>We had a narrow good weather window of two days between rain so Mike and I decide to return the next day despite our need for rest. We figured we could keep dialing in the moves and gain more endurance by putting more attempts on this almost 200 foot pitch.</p>\n<p>The next morning we woke up tired but still psyched to get back on the route. The 40 minute drive from our rented place in Canmore to the trailhead is quite pleasant with beautiful huge mountains rising right off the road. The Canadian Rockies is quite the magical place. The 2-hour hike is also quite nice, mostly on a wide tail rising at a gentle angle. We could walk side-by-side and carry on a good conversation. To gain the base of the route, you have to traverse a sloping scree ledge for 15 minutes—slightly terrifying but also an entertaining last step on the approach. After two 5.10 pitches, which we linked, you get to a perfect small ledge where you can comfortably hang out on all day, enjoying the sun and the view. The process of working on this route was amazing and we were absolutely loving it. We barely cared about sending—hanging out on the ledge and trading attempts on a thoroughly enjoyable pitch in such an outstanding place was enough!</p>\n<p>On the second day, after warming up on the 5.12+ first half of the crux pitch, I gave the full pitch another shot, mainly hoping to make it further than I did on my first attempt. After smoothly climbing through the lower parts of the route to the last good rest 15 meters from the top, I tried to mentally reset for the hard climbing. After resting till my feet hurt, I started off on the exposed arête and climbed through difficult section after difficult section and to my amazement made it to an OK undercling rest after the hardest climbing. It was still a little tricky to the top and I worried about a foot slipping or a hold breaking. Trying to rest on the edge of this overhanging arête 1000 feet in the air with the wind loudly whipping at my jacket was one of the wildest moments of my life. The rope weight made the last few moves to the anchor absurdly pumpy, but I clawed my way up.</p>\n<p>Sending this dream route 3rd try over two days was a huge surprise, but evidence of how much I’ve grown as a climber the last few years. I’ve made it a priority to continually challenge my knowledge of climbing movement through my routesetting, training, and climbing outside, and I think this has led to having the intuition and mental strength to climb such a hard route quickly even in a fatigued state. I owe some thanks to having mentors like Travis Kemp and Tonde Katiyo in my life.</p>\n<p>After sending, Mike lowered me and he gave it another go on lead. He made it through the first hard crux but didn’t have it in him to pull over a small roof, the second crux. He waited for me at the top of the pitch and I jumared up a fixed line—the most exposed and free-hanging jumar I’ve ever done (terrifying!!)—and we climbed the last two pitches to the top of the wall. The route ends at the top of a wall in the middle tier of Castle Mountain. Some people walk across a football field-sized ledge and continue up low fifth class to a summit, but we opted to call it a day and rap the route. The crux pitch is the main event for this one, and quite a good one at that. Thank you Sonnie Trotter for such a brilliant route!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/Hadley-Castles-in-the-Sky-Base'' alt=''Hadley-Castles-in-the-Sky-Base''/></figure><h3>Beta</h3>\n<p>A 60m fixed line is necessary for working the crux pitch comfortably. Usually people climb the pitch with a grigri or ATC (lighter) and rap the fixed line to get down. There are midway anchors but the climb is so overhung and left trending that it would be very hard/annoying to get back to them to re-thread. We had a 90m 8.5mm Beal Opera—the lightest single rope available—and we could lower a few bolts from the top using the fixed line to pull ourselves back to the belay. That way we didn’t have to carry a device to rap with. You definitely don’t need a 90m rope but it was nice and if you’re planning on trying The Shining Uncut on Mt. Louis, you will need it.</p><p>The first tow 5.10 pitches can be linked with 19 draws. The crux pitch takes around 35 draws and is closely bolted, especially at the top where it’s hard. The last couple pitches don’t take more than 15 draws. Bring a handful of long draws for the start of the crux pitch.</p><p>To gain the ledge to start the route, look up beta for the approach to Eisenhower Tower. There is a good stream where you can fill up water 1 and a quarter hours into the approach. Shortly after the stream, a climber’s trail leaves the main trail to the left. After 25-30min of steep trail, you’ll hit a 15 foot rocky step. After the step, head left to gain the scree ledge. If you hit another rocky step, you’ve gone too far. Traverse the ledge gingerly until you arrive at the base of the route. The prominent arête of the curx pitch is extremely obvious.</p><p>The route finishes on the right side of the mountain and you can easily walk off the top if you want. We just rappelled.</p><p>A comment on grade: this one might be granted a bit extra because of elements like rope drag and position. If the route was at the crag and rope weight wasn’t an issue, it would probably be just 5.13d. Have fun!</p>",

    content_html: "<p>My friend Blake Herrington originally pointed me to the undone direct start of Ten Percent Meteorological Vinculation. “Ten Percent” is a 5 pitch climb in the center of Index’s Lower Town Wall, first aided in 1972 by aid climbing legends, Bruce Carson and Dave Anderson (Carson and Yvon Chouinard were the first to climb the Nose clean, without a hammer). The first 50 feet of true start still had not been freed and was one of the most obvious remaining challenges at Index. </p>\n<p>When I got on it for the first time, I couldn’t do all the moves but I could see that it would go, and was surprised that no one had done it yet, there being no lack of strong climbers in Washington. The holds and the sequences are quite beautiful, but you can’t really tell from the ground. You really have to discover it by experiencing the moves on the wall. The style fit me quite well and it seemed like I could be the person with the right skill set to make this long standing project happen. </p>\n<p>It took about a year of getting on it here and there till I saw how it went and could link large sections. After an easy intro, the main part of the climb is only 25 moves, but 25 moves of tricky and hard vertical granite bouldering, with some classic Index funk and consistent bad feet. I linked the crux 3-move boulder for the first time this winter and knew then that it could go at any point. </p>\n<p>I decided to add 2 bolts to be consistent with how the rest of Ten Percent is bolted, and started to make attempts on lead. After 15 or so attempts over a few months, including a couple falls above the crux, I sent on a cool and dry spring evening, likely one of the last good days before the summer heat. Thank you Chad Walker for the send belay! He graciously came out just to support me.</p>\n<p>The route breaks hard right on a line of crimps to the ledge below the low anchors on Japanese Gardens. You could probably go straight up and avoid the ledge, but this seemed contrived. And instead of continuing up the 5.11+ climbing on Ten Percent I decided to end it short. It didn’t seem to fit the nature of the free variation to lengthen the pitch. </p>\n<p>I’m calling the direct free variation “En Passant,” French for “In Passing,” because it kinda sounds like “Ten Percent,” and because it’s the name of a weird chess move that seemed to have some parallels to the route. The crux clocks in around V11, and as I found out with some huge whips on my minimally placed bolts, you can fall in other places as well. I think it’s a solid step up from Amandla (5.13+) in difficulty and could be Index’s first 5.14.</p>\n<p>I was super lucky to have Andy Wickstrom photograph a really close attempt about a week before I sent. All the amazing photos posted here are his. Thank you Andy!!

    content_html: "<p>Working and sending Scarface has bookended a series of injury and health issues that I finally feel I’m coming out of. I’ve learned a lot about strategy, and how I never really had on for this route. I was always trying it at the worst times. I tried to climb it through a finger injury (not a good idea when the crux mono requires full finger health), or when I was completely out of shape, or when I was super low energy and not motivated. It would have been much less of an ordeal if I had just let it rest and waited for the right time. </p>\n<p>The route is legandary—the second 5.14 in America and the first established by an American.

    content_html: "<p>Traveling to climb isn’t just about the climbing, but also the food, culture, different landscapes and weather. Several climbers asked us why we came all the way from America to climb in Turkey. I said once, “Because you can’t find Turkey anywhere else!” Yes, American climbing is good, and if we were concerned only about the climbing, then we could have stayed home and saved a lot of money. But climbing is such an immersive activity, and it’s oftentimes the non-climbing factors that make a great climbing experience. The view. Your climbing partner. The sunshine. The food. Rest day activities. The beer at the end of the day. These things matter.</p>\n<p>The little village of Geyikbayiri, just 30 minutes’ drive outside of the Mediterranean resort city of Antalya hosts Turkey’s largest and most well-known crag. It’s a little paradise. The forested valley sits below beautiful mountains. Streams flow and goats wander about. Within a few square miles lie a handful of perfect limestone walls. The weather is not bad. The two weeks of 60 degrees and sunny weather was a nice contrast to our Seattle winter. And for rest days, beautiful Mediterranean beaches are only an hour’s drive away!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-TURKEY-2.jpg'' alt=''2019-TURKEY-2.jpg''/><p>The main wall.</p></figure><p>The rock at Geyikbayiri is incredibly featured: a paradise of tufas, pockets, and blobs. The climbing is playful and makes you feel like a child again. You’d find yourself pinching juggy tufas at 5.10, mounting stalactites at 5.11, and tossing between roof blobs at 5.13. It was quite ridiculous at times, moving over and through these large features. It’s a rare thing to experience it on such steep walls at moderate grades. This, I think, is what was special about Geyikbariri. There’s not many places in the world where you can climb pure tufas at 5.10+. For my routesetting, this was super inspiring, and an important reminder to keep trying to recreate this feeling of moving over and through large features, especially at easier grades.</p>\n<p>I wanted to have a more low-key trip and focus on enjoying the sunshine and time with my wife, Liz, so I decided beforehand not to get sucked into projecting. I wanted to see if I could go the whole trip without getting on the same route more than twice. I focused on the 13a to 13c range and gave 2-3 onsight attempts a day (onsighting means climbing a route first try with no prior information on how to do it). By the end of our two weeks there, I onsighted every 13a I got on, one 13b, and onsighted my first 13c. The trip ended up being my most productive sport climbing trip ever, without ever intending it to be. This style of climbing seems essential for keeping motivation high and improving skills. Not only was it fun to get on new routes every day, but I also felt the exercise increased the quality of my ability to adapt to the challenges each new route presented.</p>\n<p>Liz also had a good trip, sending her second 5.11 (on her second try, which means she needs to try harder routes!). It was her first long climbing trip and I’m lucky that she really enjoyed it, because that means we can do more!! Our next sunny Mediterranean sport climbing trip can’t come soon enough.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2019-TURKEY-3.jpg'' alt=''2019-TURKEY-3.jpg''/><p>Teenage girls sharing stuffed mussels in Antalya.</p></figure>",

    content_html: "<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect going into my trip to Patagonia. I had just emerged from a period of low motivation and I wasn’t sure I was quite through with it yet. Would I feel like I was wasting my time and taking unnecessary risk? Was I going there just because it was the thing to do? Patagonia was a place I had dreamed of going to, but maybe I’d feel out of place…like I shouldn’t be there.</p><p>I think I went at a good time though. With the skills and experience I’d acquired over the last couple years, Patagonia ended up feeling like something I could truly enjoy. I wasn’t overwhelmed by it. I was ready for it. I made safe decisions and I had fun. And it honestly was some of the most inspiring climbing I’d ever done.</p><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Five weeks were set aside for the trip. Pretty much the month of February. A good amount of time. Three weeks seems like the absolute minimum to give yourself a fair shot of climbing something, as the weather could be bad for weeks on end. With five weeks, I should for sure be able to climb something… Even then I wondered if I’d have enough time.</p><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>I came into the trip with zero expectations. I knew that if the weather was bad in the mountains, you could still boulder in Chaltén, the town climbers stay in. That was the only expectation I did have. I joked that it would be my longest bouldering trip. I’d never been on one longer than a few days, but maybe the weather would be so bad that I’d just boulder for five weeks. I was prepared to be OK with that. That mindset proved to be a good one because the first two weeks I was there, I only bouldered. And it’s not a bad backup plan—the bouldering is really good. We met several climbers who traveled to Chaltén just for the bouldering. The pad situation, however, is not good, and I ended up mostly climbing on boulders that the locals had padded or climbing traversing problems low to the ground that needed little to no padding. The traverses got a little old by the end of the trip. It’s nice to climb up.</p><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>The daily routine in Chaltén starts out with coffee brought from the States—because you can’t find good coffee down there—and reading weather forecasts. “When’s the next window?” was the question constantly in our minds. Often what seemed like a clearing a week out would completely disappear in a few days, and most “windows” would deteriorate in length and quality by the time they finally arrived. A couple times it looked like we were going to get a four or five day “mega window,” and both ended up being merely one, or maybe two separate days of good weather.</p><p>There is a lot of pre-window talk down there. Everyone wants to know what everyone else is planning on climbing. But the talk was usually a waste of time because the weather changed so much. Before most windows, we didn’t have a solid-ish plan till the day before. One time we didn’t decide which side of the range we’d hike into until 30 minutes before leaving.</p><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Finally a three day window arrived—really just two good days with a bad day in the middle. The first day of that window was going to be too cold to rock climb, so Austin Siadak—my main climbing partner for the trip—and I decided that we should go for a “winter” route—basically a route we could climb in boots, crampons, gloves, and ice axes, verses “rock climbing” with bare hands and rock shoes. We decided to try the Whillans-Cochrane on Poincenot.</p><p>Poincenot, the third highest peak of the Torre and Fitz Roy spires, is one of the most beautiful in the Fitz Roy group. Its prominent and piercing spire competes with Fitz Roy (Cerro Chaltén, as it’s locally known) itself. Due to recent warm weather and storms, the snow ramp leading to the start of the “technical” climbing was melted out and then covered with fresh storm snow. We arrived at the base of the route as several parties were bailing. The loose snow over rock didn’t look ideal. I was psyched to have Austin’s Patagonia experience for what turned out to be an earlier-than-expected crux at the beginning of the route. If it weren’t for him, I would have joined the fleeing parties.</p><p>Once we made it to the mixed “crux” (M4 or 5 in the current conditions), I took the lead, only because I felt bad about all the leading Austin had been doing up to that point. After navigated a scary slab in crampons, we were cruising on solid rock and good ice—comfortable territory for both of us. As we rounded the mountain and made it to the summit, I got my first views of the Torres—some of the most beautiful spires of rock in the world. Even though I never got to touch rock with my bare hands and rock shoes, Poincenot was an amazing and very memorable first Patagonian climb for me. It was also important for Austin—it was the last spire in the Fitz Roy skyline that he had not climbed.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/2018-HADLEY-POINCENOT-DESCENT-TORRES.jpg'' alt=''2018-HADLEY-POINCENOT-DESCENT-TORRES.jpg''/><p>Austin rapping off the summit of Poincenot with the Torres in the background.</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>After Poincenot, Austin and I rested out a rainy and windy day in high camp and prepared to attempt Aguja Pollone with Colin Haley and Andy Wyatt the next day. We planned to climb a route called La Granja via the Japanese direct start as two teams of two. The pitches on this route ended up being some of the best alpine rock pitches we’ve ever climbed. Splitter hand and finger cracks, and hero jug flakes. The whole route follows a prominent eastern arête that juts out over an epic glacial landscape. The quality of the climbing, the beauty of the line, the mountain, and position make this route destined to be a classic. The whole day was type-1 fun—a rarity in such serious mountains.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/AgujaPollone.jpg'' alt=''AgujaPollone.jpg''/><p>Colin approaching Aguja Pollone.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/P5490381.jpg'' alt=''P5490381.jpg''/><p>Austin on one of the many amazing pitches of La Granja.</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Back in town, we did more bouldering and trail running and religiously checked the forecasts for the next window. The scene in town is beautifully social—lots of climbers hanging around and waiting for good weather. El Chaltén is small, but because of its booming recreational appeal as the “trekking capital of South America,” it has many small grocers, cafes, restaurants, and even a brewery. Most days in Chaltén ended with happy hour at “Fresco,” where climbers gather and share stories of the last window, celebrate successes, and bond over surviving another day in Patagonia.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P2010069.jpg'' alt=''P2010069.jpg''/><p>Josie trying to decide if she wants to go for it.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/2018-HADLEY-GATO-NEGRO.jpg'' alt=''2018-HADLEY-GATO-NEGRO.jpg''/><p>Will on 'Gato Negro.'</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Later that week we got a small blip of good weather—not enough time to spend a night in high camp—so we would have to get in and out of the mountains Chaltén-toChaltén. Andy and I decided to team up to do a quick climb of Guillaumet, a mountain neither of us had climbed and one of the most accessible for a town-totown mission. Andy is the owner of the climbing gym I routeset for and super talented athlete. Him and Colin Haley set the car-to-car speed record of Fitz Roy and, back in Washington, Mt. Stuart''s North Ridge. I was excited to see if I could keep up!</p><p>We climbed a “sit-start” to the most popular route, the “Fonrouge”—in total, a 2500-foot ridge climb. The day, although windy at times, was beautiful, and the route was easy enough to climb mostly unroped, save a few pitches. The route could be considered the “North Ridge of Stuart” of Patagonia…although not quite as good. We traveled about 18 miles that day, climbed a 2500-foot route, gained 6500 feet, all over about 11 hours—still a lot of ground to cover for being one of the most accessible routes! (A couple weeks later, a group of climbers did that same thing two hours faster!)</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P5490468.jpg'' alt=''P5490468.jpg''/><p>Andy low on the ridge.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/P5490485-2.jpg'' alt=''P5490485-2.jpg''/><p>Andy at a belay after the crux pitch of the Fonrouge.</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Three weeks had flown by and I was beginning to feel like I was running out of time. Eventually some promising weather showed up on the horizon. But first more bouldering, trail-running, and happy hour-ing.</p><p>I would of loved to do something new in the mountains down there—a first ascent or a first free ascent. For me climbing is more rewarding the more it is creatively expressive. But ultimately we never got the weather, and for the little windows we had my priority was to just explore and get to know the range and climb some of the classics. I did, however, come out of the trip with a Patagonian bouldering first ascent—one of my most memorable experiences down there. At the annual Festival de Boulder in Chaltén, I climbed on several freshly cleaned boulders that some locals prepared just for the festival, and I managed to be the first to climb one of them, quite possibly the “king line.”</p><p>The line goes straight up a tall and clean 40° overhang with cool holds and great movement—about all you could ask for. When I walked up to people trying the line, most of the climbers were taking epic falls from the top, missing the pads, and thankfully being caught by a large group of spotters. I assumed someone had already climbed it and I gave it a few tries, dropping off each time because I was scared. Then I heard that it actually hadn’t been climbed yet, so I decided to give it a little more effort. After a couple more tries, I found a body position in which I felt in control, committed to the last few moves, and pulled over the lip. I felt like I was competing again, and it brought back a exhilarating memory of a cheering crowd when I was the only person to send a route at nationals. I called the line La Puerta Abierta, “The Open Door,” upon recommendation from Austin who heard someone yell, “the door is open!” after I topped it out. The name also recognizes those who worked hard to prepare and save this boulder for the festival. It’s about V9, with maybe a half-grade granted to it due to its committing nature.</p><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Finally, in my last week, some good weather came and Andy, Austin and I decided to try a route out of the Torre Valley. We attempted “Last Gringos Standing” on St. Exupery, but only got a couple pitches up before bailing because of wind and cold. I think that day turned out to be much colder than expected and a number of parties had to bail. Perhaps we could have chosen an easier and more sheltered route, but I’m not sure we could have known how bad it would be. Our one failure still ended up being a great camping trip—the Torre Valley is likely the most beautiful place I’ve ever been in my life.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/TorresAtDawn.jpg'' alt=''TorresAtDawn.jpg''/><p>The Torres at dawn from the Torre Valley.</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>After hiking out of the Torre Valley in a storm, I only had a few days left before my flight back home. The forecast showed one last day of good weather the day before I had to catch a 6am bus to the airport. If we went for something big, I would likely have to hike solo across a broken glacier and navigate a descent I’d never done before in the dark. It would be a bit risky and a bit of a gamble with the possibility of missing a very expensive flight. But there was one route, the Pilar Rojo on Mermoz, that I really wanted to climb, so Austin and I decided to go for it. At high camp, a couple good friends from Seattle, Andy and Kelsey, offered to help me get out of the mountains safely and in time for my bus. They had a car and would wait for me to get back to the road via a trail I knew well, and drive me back to town, so I wouldn’t have to navigate an unfamiliar technical descent on my own. I didn’t have access to a car and it would’ve been too late to get a taxi, so I hadn’t considered this option, but it was a huge relief when they made it possible.</p><p>The next day Austin and I successfully climbed the Pilar Rojo with four of our other friends right behind us. We almost onsighted the consistently 5.11+, 2000foot climb, except for a short slab traverse that Austin aided through and I sent third try. It was a battle to keep it together for the last bit of burly crack climbing—Austin was cramping up and I just felt super tired. The climbing was the definition of “splitter,” almost too splitter for me, a pretty mediocre crack climber. We got off the mountain in the light and I ended up making it back to town by 3am. After a two-hour nap, I caught my bus to the airport, and was quickly transported back to Seattle. I felt extremely lucky to end my trip with such a high quality Patagonia free climb. It’s possible that that last day was the only day that conditions aligned enough to make climbing the Pilar Rojo possible. A couple of our friends had attempted that route several times that season and never got a chance to take it to the top.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P5490667.jpg'' alt=''P5490667.jpg''/><p>Austin on the first 11d pitch.

Splitter hands for 200 feet!</p></figure><hr class=''sm'' width=''25%''><p>Naturally, I wonder if I’ll go back to such an amazing place. When I was down there I was already talking about being back next year. Back home, I wonder if I’d like to use my “big trip budget” to see another part of the world. I’m sure I will eventually go back, but I’m not sure when. I honestly was surprised at how high-quality the alpine granite was—it really is good. But what wasn’t surprising was how hard it is to get good conditions to rock climb—Patagonia’s stormy reputation is extremely accurate. That’s partly what makes it special though, and also what would make a rock climber like me secondguess going back! Doing a rad alpine rock climb down there is not guaranteed, but I was lucky to do a few.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/P5490182.jpg'' alt=''P5490182.jpg''/><p>Chaltén below a shrouded Fitz Roy.</p></figure>",

    content_html: "<p>When you drive into Yosemite Valley, El Capitan is one of the first things that you see—one of the most beautiful hunks of stone on the planet, and the object of many climbers’ dreams. And this definitely goes for me. I too am irresistibly drawn to climbing’s Great Supermodel.</p><p>And so it was my plan to get intimate with the Supermodel this last October. I hadn’t been to the Valley in 10 years—the last time I was there, I was 15. Now, in my great climbing maturity, I was ready for the Captain. And I believed I was ready to free climb it. But unfortunately for me, due to heat and crowds, the trip ended up being a tour of some hard and classic free climbs on the shady side of the Valley.</p><p>Blake Herrington and I arrived in El Portal late on a Friday night, October 20th. The plan was to sleep in a bit and get a casual start for a route on Fifi Buttress. Blake wanted to get on Romulan Warbird (V 5.12c), but I wanted to go straight for Final Frontier (V 5.13b). Blake put forth that we should start slow and I had to relent. I was probably being too ambitious.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-1.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-1.jpg''/><p>Blake on Romulan Warbird.</p></figure><p>The next morning, we were at the base of the route at a causal 11pm, with our friends Nik Berry and Bronson Hovie 2 pitches above us. “How was the first pitch?” I yelled up at Nik. “Kinda hard. And the rock doesn’t feel very grabby.” Blake and I tossed a carabiner for the first lead. The CAMP side landed up and the 12b warmup pitch was all mine. I eked through it, and so did Blake, and we continued to eke our way through the rest of the route, including two more pitches of 5.12. The climbing was amazing, and the belay ledges were even more amazing—key ingredients for a classic free climb. I would climb this route many more times, and was glad Blake pushed for it. It was a great way to start our trip.</p><p>Coming from Washington, and especially coming from climbing at Index, it was a relief to be able to climb 5.12 pitches on granite first try fairly comfortably. (5.12 is also no gimmy at “local” PNW crags like Little Si, Squamish and Smith!) Not very many climbers have onsighted Index 5.12, and by the end of our first day, I had already onsighted more 5.12s in Yosemite than I had ever at Index.</p><p>Two days later, we were back at Fifi Buttress for Final Frontier. We were psyched to have some 5.11 pitches to warm-up on this time. When arrived at the crux block of 12d, 13a, 13b, and 12c, we were psychologically taken out by poor stances and poorly situated belays. The anchor bolts were always just left or right of the stance, so that you were forced into a hanging belay with ledge just out of reach! I onsighted the first 12d, sent the 13a, and felt close on the 13b after one try, but Blake wasn’t as close to sending and we were both a little irritable from having to hang in our harnesses so much, so we called it and rapped from the base of the 12c. Several days later, I returned with my friend Austin Siadak to finish the route and lead every pitch with no falls. Almost all of the pitches on this route are amazing. Nik Berry and James Lucas did a nice thing by freeing this route, though I have a slight grudge against them for not making the belays more free-climbing friendly. Alas, it is all of our responsibly though, and I could have done it myself.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-3.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-3.jpg''/><p>Austin on Final Frontier, with Max and Blake below.</p></figure><p>We wanted to climb the next day but didn’t want to hang in our harnesses at all so we decided on the Rostrum (IV 5.11c), which supposedly had good ledges, not-to-mention it being a Yosemite classic. The night before climbing it, Austin, Blake and I sat in the living room of our place in El Portal discussing how to climb it most efficiently as a team of 3, and decided to try climbing the route in 5 long pitches, leader fixing, and the two followers following simultaneously on mini-traxions. We called the middle follower the parasite. This ended up working well. On a somewhat non-meandering route, the two followers were not pulled to the side at all. Blake and Austin said that even following the traverse on the last pitch was smooth. After leading a 200ft pitch, the leader could just chill, and work on a crossword puzzle, or some other productive thing. No trying to belay two people simultaneously, and since we only needed one rope, and because it was always just hanging straight down below us, there was literally no rope management work necessary. Just long glorious pitches. We were slowed down a bit by a team from Norway, but we’re good friends with them now, and found out that the granite in Norway is better than Squamish and Yosemite. But what about Index? TBD. I think we started at 1pm and finished around 5pm.</p><p>After the Rostrum, our friend Max Tepfer arrived in the Valley. It was still quite hot, and wanting to try a route on a different formation, we decided on Border Country (V 5.12c) on Middle Cathedral. Blake used a random number generator on his computer to decide who would climb with who. On this party ascent, I’d climb with Max, and Austin would climb with Blake. Max and I simuled the first 7 pitches to the crux headwall in 3 leads. The intro pitches were fun featured 5.8-5.10 face climbing, but the real gems of this route are the 4 headwall pitches of 12a, 12c, 11+ and 11+. Max wanted to lead the 12c, which he had tried before, but hadn’t sent, so we decide to swing leads with me starting with the 12a. I onsighted this pitch and after watching Max’s beta for the low crux on the 12c, flashed that as well. The 11+ pitches went smoothly for both of us and we stopped back at the crux 12c on our way down so Max could re-lead and send. Blake and Austin were above us at this point and Austin took one of the better iPhone photos I’ve seen of Max hiking the thing in the day’s last glimmers of light. Send of the day. The features, the knobs, odd pockets, and ribs were amazing. Those four pitches contained some of best, most interesting granite I’ve ever climbed on. Thanks Jeremy Collins, Dana Drummond, and Mikey Schaefer for the beautiful route!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-4.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-4.jpg''/><p>Max on Border Country.</p></figure><p>At this point in the trip, after about a week, I knew El Cap was not going to happen. I wasn’t feeling much psych from Blake, which was reasonable because it was so warm. It was supposed to cool down after my wife, Liz, was going to arrive, and but I didn’t want to leave her to hang out alone for her first few days of her first trip to Yosemite. I talked to Josh Wharton and Nik Berry a bit about coming back later in November to have a shot at it, but they both either found partner before I committed or had an old partner come through later. Freeing El Cap was a big goal for 2017, something I really wanted to do, but it wasn’t meant to be. Good thing it’s not going anywere.</p><p>Monday, October 30th, was the last day I had to give another hard route a shot before I had to pick Liz up at the Sacramento airport that evening. Max had been working on the Westie Face (V 5.13a A0) of the Leaning Tower the previous season and was psyched to get back on it. I was pretty sure I had a good chance at sending it in a day, and maybe even a slight chance at an onsight. It was at least not out of the realm of possibility. Max’s goal was to re-remember the moves, so we decided I would lead most of the route.</p><p>The day before getting on the route, Max and I hiked up to the base to fix the initial 200ft bolt ladder that gets you into the free climbing. We rock-paper-scissored over who would lead it and I lost, which was probably a good thing because I had literally no aid climbing experience and a 200ft bolt ladder would probably be a good start. It felt like it took forever, even after getting into a rhythm of it. Without a hook, I had to pull a mandatory free move over a roof, that actually felt kinda hard in approach shoes. I made it through though and we were ready for a speedy ascent the next day.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-5.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-5.jpg''/><p>The Leaning Tower.</p></figure><p>With a 5:30am alarm, we were probably at the base of our fixed line by 7:30am. We ascended our line to a hanging corner, several hundred feet off the ground. It was an intimidating start, needless-to-say, with 12c difficulties right off the belay. I didn’t handle the exposure and pressure to send very well and felt pretty shaky. I made it through the first cruxy moves but punted when I shook myself off a small foot. Blew the onsight. I lowered to the belay and yo-yo back up to where I fell before and finished the pitch. The next pitch, the crux pitch, contains two cruxy sections separated by a stance on a slab, a first one at around 12d, and a second at around 13a. As I was about to exiting the first crux, I tightened up, stopped breathing, and fell. I lowered, pulled the rope, and immediately got back on the pitch, still quite pumped. I relaxed my way through the first crux and onsighted the rest of the pitch, including the 13a crux. Having climbed the first two pitches almost twice each, I was already a bit tired and pumped with 4 more pitches of 5.12 and one 11+ to go. But the crux was behind me so I was pretty confident it would go. Sure enough, the rest of the pitches went first try. We topped out around 2pm and I was pretty pooped from all the steep climbing. I think I had been carrying a low-level flash pump with me the whole day. I was glad to send, but a little bummed about my poor performance on the first two pitches. We were back in El Portal by 5pm and I was at the Sacramento airport by 9pm to pick up Liz and back in El Portal after midnight. A long day, but good last day of hard climbing!</p><p>For the rest of the week, I was able to enjoy some of Yosemite’s classic moderate routes with Liz, like the East Buttress of Middle Cathedral, Nutcracker, and Serenity Crack. It was early November and the Valley was starting to clear out and quiet down. It was a fitting way to end the trip, but seeing El Cap everyday, and knowing that it would have to wait, made me a bit sad. But for now, I had had a great first “mature” trip to the Yosemite and a most excellent tour of the darker side of the valley.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-7.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-7.jpg''/><p>Liz on the East Buttress, Middle Cathedral.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-6.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-6.jpg''/><p>Moody day on Middle Cathedral.</p></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-8.jpg'' alt=''HADLEY-2017-YOSEMITE-8.jpg''/><p>Half Dome.</p></figure>",

    content_html: "<p>My good friend, Travis Kemp, and I climbed Vanishing Point about a month ago, and I know some people have been curious about this route and would benefit from even a short trip report. There is still time to climb this route this season, but it''s dwindling!</p><p>Vanishing Point on Dolomite Tower, a subpeak of Mt. Baring, climbs one of the most impressive, clean faces in the state, even country. The Liberty Bell group at Washington Pass is hard to beat as far as aesthetics and quality of climbing goes, but the north face of Mt. Baring is almost right up there with it. It''s beautiful! But no one climbs on it!! Yeah, yeah, the rock is not quite as good. But the rock on Vanishing Point was overwhelmingly good--loose rock was the exception. If this thing was in Europe, it would probably be famous. I mean they climb on shit over there and this is definitely pretty good! Right? Just kidding...</p><p>Bryan Burdo first climbed his masterpiece Vanishing Point in 1999 and gave called it Grade VI 5.12b--which is a pretty big grade (The Nose on El Cap is Grade VI!). Taken as a whole, to climb the north face of Mt. Baring, you must ascend around 3000ft of semi-technical to very technical (overhanging!) terrain. To get the base of the Dolomite Tower prow ('the approach'), you must climb up steep gullies, a 60-70° forested rib with fixed lines, and around 800ft of mostly roped-up slab. Finally, where the real climbing starts, you have a nearly 1500ft overhanging prow looming above you that is VERY sustained at 5.11+/5.12. Bryan Burdo took 3-days on his ascent, though now, competent parties have done it in one long day.</p><p>Travis and I had been talking about doing this route since we saw it in Blake Herrington''s book Cascade Rock. After a year of waffling, we finally set a date. In order to cut out the 1.5 hour drive from Seattle, we drove to Travis'' cabin in Skykomish on a Thursday night after routesetting at Seattle Bouldering Project. The next day, we were up at 5am and were at the Barclay Lake Trailhead by around 6am. The approach starts out on a pleasant level trail until you reach a creek bed, which you can walk in, or alternatively, walk through relatively open forest right of the creek, until you reach a boulder field. Once in the boulder field, you can see your whole route: up a rocky wash to a ramp onto the forested rib; up fixed lines in the forested rib; back left into the gully; up the gully until reaching bolted slabs to the left; up the slabs; across a large ledge to the left; up a gully with bolts and gear occasionally on the face to the right; up more slabs and ledges diagonaling left to the base of the tower. (Phew! That''s you''re brief approach beta from me!). We nailed the 'approach' without pre-scouting, thanks to a good description in Blake''s guidebook, and were at the base of Dolomite Tower at 8:30am.</p><p>Man, I''m writing more than I thought. I need to wrap this up! But onto the real climbing...but briefly! I lead the first two pitches combined with no event. Travis took the 3rd, which is runout and the site of a huge fall and injury of a competent northwest climber. Sure enough it was sketchy and scary--glad Travis lead it! We thought a #2, which we didn''t have, might have protected the moves off of the flake. Pitch 4, the only all-gear pitch, was fun and well-protected. Then pitch 5, the pitch that almost ruined our day. Travis set off up towards a roof that we were supposed to climb through, according to Blake''s description, but Travis found hard climbing, no bolts, and very loose rock that would likely break and fall directly on me. Spooked, he lowered and we talked about bailing. I decided I would go and check it out. I put in a #1 in a suspect flake under the roof and thought about committing to some slopers but had no idea what was above them. I bailed, and moved to the far right where there were some bolts on the face, back cleaning as I went to lessen the rope drag. I''m not sure of the difficulty of the climbing because of the hanging and back cleaning, but I was able to climb around the roof and the loose flakes to the 'alt. belay' marked in Blake''s topo. OK, I thought, we were going to do this, but now it became about getting to the top. Free climbing wasn''t the goal anymore. Just climbing fast. And that we did.</p><p>After many, many gloriously exposed, hard, sustained, overhanging, and nerve-numbing, but safe, pitches we reached the top 7.5 hours after starting at the base of the tower at around 4pm. The descent, thank god, though long, is fully non-technical, and we were back to the car at 6:30pm. Grade VI, car-to-car in 12.5 hours--not bad! Maybe Grade V is more appropriate... But since we failed to free climb the route, at least we were fast. And we were definitely happy--it was one of the most exciting climbs we had ever done. I definitely would do it again, but I might need some time to let the memory settle...</p><p>I talked to Blake afterward about pitch 5, and he dug up a picture of the roof from when he climbed it. Sure enough, as we suspected, a serious chunk of the roof is now gone. The route as they climbed it is no longer possible/recommended/safe. If it weren''t for the mystery bolts out left, the route would not safely go. I have no idea how hard the climbing there is though, but probably between 5.11+ and 5.12+, so it is likely another crux. Below is a marked-up copy of Blake''s topo. Do it!!</p><figure><img src=''/assets/IMG_5894.PNG'' alt=''IMG_5894.PNG''/></figure>",

    content_html: "<p><em>This is an article that I wrote for MSR''s blog. You can find it published on their site </em><a href='https://thesummitregister.com/winter-climbing-tips/'><em>here</em></a>.</p><p>The freedom of moving high in the mountains is one of the best feelings in the world. Unfortunately for many with the mountain climbing bug, these experiences are limited to a few summer-time months. If this is you, then what do you do with your mountain-starved soul the other eight to nine months out of the year? Do you catch yourself dreaming of trails through colorful alpine meadows and scrambles up high rocky ridges? You might be able to keep your soul semi-satisfied by climbing lowland rock, heading to the busy ski resort, or holing up with some good mountaineering literature, but we all know that these are just meager replacements for the real thing—the deeply rewarding adventure of climbing mountains.</p><p>So why not climb mountains the rest of the year as well? Particularly, in the winter and spring?</p><p>Yeah, it’s complicated, I know. The weather is not as good. Days are short. It’s really, really cold. Snow and ice make what would be simple summer scrambles committing and dangerous. There’s the risk of an early entombment by avalanche. And all that extra gear…</p><p>But I would argue that it’s worth it. So worth it. <strong>If not just for the freedom and challenge of moving in the hills year-round, off season climbing is great preparation for bigger mountains like Mt. Rainier or Denali, where “winter conditions” permanently exist.</strong></p><p>After I moved to Seattle two years ago, I had a hard time getting though my first Pacific Northwest winter. It was rainy and dark, and the dry and sunny rock climbing that I was used to coming from the Front Range of Colorado was not always an option. I realized I needed to diversify my skillset, otherwise I’d be stuck daydreaming of summer. Enter winter climbing.</p><p>What’s the best way to get started? Here are a few of my observations.</p><p><strong>1. Find a partner and/or mentor.</strong></p><p>This might be the crux! Finding someone with an obsessive love for the mountains to be your partner on cold winter climbs can be tough.</p><p>Ideally this person is more experienced then you and can act as a mentor. The nuances of snow, weather, clothing, and equipment are a bit overwhelming in the winter, so it is almost essential to find someone to learn from. And sadly, the practice of mentoring seems to be dying out in our Information Age. You can easily find articles like this and go try something new on your own, which is good and bad. It’s wonderful that you can learn so much for free and on your own, but <strong>nothing replaces being “in the field” with someone more knowledgeable than you</strong>. So how do you find a mentor? First, they are never strangers—they can only be found among the people with whom you already interact. Search your current network. Maybe you can be introduced to a friend-of-a-friend who gets after it year ‘round. <strong>Oftentimes it is the mentor that chooses you, not the other way around.</strong> So be someone you would want to climb with.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-2.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-2.jpeg''/></figure><p><strong>2. Learn about snow.</strong></p><p>Avalanche awareness may be the biggest barrier to getting into winter climbing. Don’t let it be a barrier and be proactive about learning. There are abundant resources out there. Reading a book with good visuals is also recommended, but <strong>there is no replacing learning from experience.</strong> Taking an avalanche awareness course is recommended, especially if your climbing partner is not an expert. Most areas have avalanche danger forecasting, like what’s provided by the Northwest Avalanche Center here in Washington.</p><p>Cornices, another winter-specific danger, form when windblown snow accumulates horizontally on ridge crests, hanging suspended out past supporting rock. Like avalanche slopes, cornices can collapse without warning, or a climber could break through. To be safe, travel well below the probable fracture line, which can be much lower than you’d think. Mature cornices could have a fracture line 30 or more feet back from the lip. <strong>The safest strategy is to completely avoid traveling near cornices.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Pick an objective.</strong></p><p>Start small. Pick a route that you can <em>very</em> comfortable climb without a rope in the summer. This may mean a class 1 “hike.” <strong>Remember that what is trivial in the summer turns into an exciting challenge in the winter. </strong>Think Grade 1 or 2 for starters. Winter specific route information can be hard to find. Some winter climbing beta can be found on SummitPost.com, so start here. Study route beta for summer conditions online (summitpost.com and mountainproject.com) and in physical guidebooks, and check online trip reports, at the very least. You can’t bet on finding a climbers trail—it will be buried in snow!—so it is extra important to be knowledgeable of the main features of your chosen route. Print out a photo of the whole route to take with you, as well as extra photos of key features, <strong>including the descent</strong> (!!).</p><p>I’ve listed a few examples climbs to get the wheels turning. There is lots of information online about each of these popular routes. If you pick a nice weekend day to climb any of them, you should have company and hopefully a pre-broken trail!</p><p><strong>Lion Head Route, Mt. Washington (6288’), New Hampshire. </strong></p><p>What Mt. Washington lacks in height, it makes up for with brutal weather. The wind and cold temperatures can be extremely severe, so pay attention to the weather forecast. The Lion Head Route is perhaps the easiest and least avalanche prone route to the summit.</p><p><strong>East Ridge, Quandary Peak (14,265’), Colorado.</strong></p><p>This may be the most popular first Colorado fourteener to climb in the winter. The trailhead near 11,000ft is accessible in the winter, making the climb itself only about 3000ft. The avalanche danger on the ridge is low. I climbed this route a while ago on a warm spring day with my wife and forgot sunscreen. Long story short, because of the intense radiation due to the snow-covered slopes and high elevation, we looked like Oompa Loompas for the next week.</p><p><strong>Worm Flows Route, Mt. St. Helens (8,364’), Washington.</strong></p><p>Since the top got blown off, this has become a much more reasonable climb in the winter. As with the Lion Head Route, don’t let the lack of elevation deceive you—this mountain gets dumped on in the winter! This route is long—gainng about 5,700 feet in elevation over about 6 miles from trailhead to summit, so start early.</p><p><strong>Whitney Trail Route, Mt. Whitney (14,505’), California.</strong></p><p>Whitney is kind of the holy grail of winter mountaineering in California, and not necessarily a good first winter climb, though it is reasonably well sought-after, with good information available. Most of the Californian’s I met when I climbed Denali had done a practice climb on Whitney in winter as training. The Whitney Trail is a long trail in the summer, gaining almost 6000ft, so be prepared for a very long day, or better yet, plan to bivy. The Mountaineers Route is also a popular objective in winter, though it is much more technical.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-3.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-3.jpeg''/></figure><p><strong>4. Gather the right clothing.</strong></p><p>It goes without saying that it’s important to stay warm and dry. We do want this to be fun, right? OK, maybe we just want to survive. The ideal system will vary based on preference, weather, season, and location.</p><p>A basic system includes:</p><p>· Warm wool socks</p><p>· Long johns</p><p>· Long sleeve baselayer, preferably with a hood (no cotton!)</p><p>· Soft shell and/or hard shell pants depending on conditions</p><p>· Breathable insulated mid-layer or fleece</p><p>· Shell jacket</p><p>· Parka</p><p>· Gloves: two or three pairs recommended to have an extra dry pair</p><p>· Warm hat</p><p>· Balaclava or BUFF for wind and sun protection</p><p>· Sunglasses: category 3 or 4 lenses</p><p>Dealing with gloves is one of the trickiest issues of cold weather climbing. You may have to sacrifice warmth and waterproofness for dexterity. I usually carry a thinner fitted glove and a bigger warmer and more waterproof glove. If your gloves get wet, don’t worry—this is usually unavoidable when you plunge your hands in snow for hours. That’s why you pack extras.</p><p><strong></strong></p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-4.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-4.jpeg''/></figure><p><strong>5. Gather the right gear.</strong></p><p>My usual tactic is to borrow as much as I can so I can try difference kinds of gear out before spending large amounts of money. And don’t be afraid to try to make do with what you already have. I used waterproof summer boots for many of my first winter jaunts—I just made sure that my socks were extra thick! It’s better to get after it then sit around blabbering about the newest technology and worrying about getting the “right” gear. Sometimes the right gear is what you already have or your grandpa’s hand-me-downs. Either way, it will be hard to get around having to invest in some new and expensive shiny things, because the right gear is about your comfort and safety.</p><p>Below is a basic list for the new winter mountaineer. Yeah, it’s long. If you haven’t realized it yet, you have to carry a lot more in the winter.</p><p>· 45ish liter pack</p><p>· Harness with adjustable leg loops (to fit over bulky clothing)</p><p>· Dry-treated rope</p><p>· Boots: leather insulated mountaineering boots (warmer and stiffer than hiking boots)</p><p>· Crampons: step in mountaineering (strap-on) crampons with horizontal front points.</p><p>· Mountaineering ice axe and/or ice tools depending on route</p><p>· Climbing helmet</p><p>· Snowshoes or skis</p><p>· Trekking poles</p><p>· Shovel</p><p>· Avalanche beacon and probe</p><p>· Nalgene w/bottle insulator (so your water doesn’t freeze!)</p><p>· Small thermos: optional, but nice to have</p><p>· Backpack: 35 – 70 liters.</p><p>· Gaiters</p><p>· Map and compass (be prepared to navigate in a whiteout)</p><p>· Food: anything that can easily and quickly be stuffed in your mouth!</p><p>· Climbing gear (pickets, cams, stoppers, pitons, ice screws, etc) depending on route</p><p>If you’re planning to bivy, you’re going to need a new tent—3-season tents are not designed to withstand the weight of snow or sub-freezing temperatures. A single wall tent is usually the lightest/best option. If you are basecamping, a double-wall tent cuts back on condensation, and might be worth the weight. It’s normal for temperatures to drop to around 0°F in most ranges, so bring a warm enough sleeping bag. <strong>An insulated sleeping pad is essential</strong>—nothing steels heat like lying on a bed of snow! Also, you’ll be carrying a warm parka, so plan on wearing it to bed!</p><p>If you’re not planning on bivying, then pay attention to time, and bail if you’re moving too slow. <strong>Remember, days are short!</strong> Know the time of sunset. Bringing an emergency bivy sack or shelter is wise. They are super light and usually not too expensive.</p><p>Ideal climbing protection is different in the winter. Spring-loaded cams that are bomber in the summer can be a joke in an icy crack, or when frozen solid due to full-on winter conditions. Passive protection, like stoppers and tri-cams, works regardless of ice, so if your route calls for rock protection, carry some cams, but make sure you have plenty of passive protection. Oftentimes, pitons are thrown onto a winter rack because they can be used in thin cracks and seams—where other rock protection does not work. It can be important to have this option when protection is hard to come by (because it’s covered by ice and snow). Pickets are often carried to the top of a climb without being used—they require very firm snow conditions, which can be hard to find in the winter. If all of this protection-talk sounds scary, stick to easy climbs that don’t require roping up, especially if winter climbing is new for you.</p><p>A note on food: besides giving you sustained energy, eating keeps you warm, so bring enough to be able to eat consistently. Because it’s cold, you may not feel thirsty, so you will also have to force yourself to drink consistently to stay hydrated.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-5.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-5.jpeg''/></figure><p><strong>6. Go for it!</strong></p><p>Start small and find the right challenge for you. If you want, take a course. Many guiding companies offer winter climbing courses in New England, the Rockies, Sierras, and Cascades. Try to find opportunities to learn new skills like ice climbing and backcountry skiing that you can bring to the mountains in winters to come. <strong>Check the weather.</strong> Check noaa.gov and use the spot forecasting function. Mountain-forcast.com is also helpful. Call the local ranger station to ask about up-to-date conditions if you can. Most importantly, get out there, make wise decisions, and enjoy the beautiful transformation winter brings to the mountains.</p>",

    content_html: "<p>New York Gulley has been one of the main objectives on the winter ticklist for us. It was potentially the perfect route with serious and interesting climbing to do in decent time Seattle-to-Seattle. We were a little too eager to climb it this season. Excited from the early cold temperatures in December, we climbed the first pitch of the direct variation, but decided to bail due to slow, precarious movement on a route that was not in condition.</p><p>After a very busy holiday season, we were finally able to attempt it again last Friday, the fateful inaugural day, which was declared by him we shall not name, “National Day of Patriotic Devotion.” I’m not sure we had our priorities straight that day. We made it to Snoqualmie Pass and found that freezing rain and wind had obliterated the area. No one had been up there for days. All the lifts were closed. We started putting in a skin track through 5ish inches of heavy snow sitting on a layer of ice. The ice was causing us to slide around everywhere. We were moving incredibly slow. Too slow. And it wasn’t fun. We bailed after not making it up even a quarter of the approach.</p><p>Third time’s the charm, right? We decided to go for it again just a few days later, on Monday, January 23rd. Travis was at my house at 7:15am after dropping his two-year-old, Sawyer, off at their nanny’s. Being the main caretaker of a toddler while his wife finishes up her residency is wearing on Travis a little, to say the least, and making it difficult for him to get into the mountains as often as he’d like. But we were thankful that he has a great nanny who will take his son as early as 7am. No alpine start, which means we needed to move efficiently. We were at the Alpental parking lot around 8am and found slightly better snow conditions <em>and</em> a skin track. Things were looking a lot better for us. We left the truck at about 8:15, skinned up a couple thousand feet of elevation, making it to the ridge over-looking the intimidating north face of Snoqualmie Mountain at about 10am.</p><p>We ditched our skis and descend down below the face and then slogged up to the base of the exposed snow ramps that marked the beginning of the route. When I pulled out my crampons, I realized I had grabbed my wife’s set and that the straps were cut too short to fit over my ski boots. I threaded the strap through the toe and immediately back to the buckle, leaving the other side of the heel loose. Amazingly, the lip on the heel of the boot was enough to keep it secure.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-7.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-7.jpeg''/></figure><p>I led the easy first pitch, probably 50-60 meters, placing one cam. Travis led the second pitch, a traverse to the left with an occasional short steep step, bringing us to a belay off a dead tree at the base of the main bit of the route—a steep rightward leaning ramp. Because I''m new to this kind of climbing, Travis took off again. He made quick progress, finding decent protection and several fixed pins. Around 40 meters up, on a steeper step, his pick and front points blew at the same time and his body silently fell backward. The rope started pulling though my belay device. I grab it, brake it, and get pulled into the snow in front of me. “Are you alright?” I yell up to him. I think I hear a “yes,” as Travis slowly gets back up and starts to climb again. An old pin held his fall—his first alpine fall, a fall many people never take.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-8.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-8.jpeg''/></figure><p>The climbing on the third pitch was steep and interesting, involving all kinds of frozen stuff to poke, and a bit of rock grabbing as well. Travis again took the fourth pitch as the ramp continued rightward up one last steep section to easy climbing taking us to the base of the route’s crux pitch, “the 5.8 crack.” That doesn’t sound intimidating, but climbing a crack covered in snow and ice while wearing ski boots isn’t easy. I took this pitch, so I wouldn’t feel like a total wimp, pulling on a couple pieces and then tiptoeing above small cams in icy cracks to the top of the route. Travis followed by free climbing the pitch, saying it was “actually kinda hard.” We exchanged high-fives, happy that we finally got to climb the route. We unroped and carefully walked off to the right and descended back down to our skis.</p>",

    content_html: "<p>We made it to Talkeetna last night after a three-hour shuttle from Anchorage. Anchorage was almost as I expected it to be—a little pocket of flat ground on the ocean and surrounded by mountains. In Washington, we joke about learning to appreciate and distinguish the shades of grey, but Anchorage was on another level. It was bleak, but incredibly beautiful. There were trees until the land rose even the slightest—then grey. Even the ocean was grey.</p><p>We’re waiting for the weather to clear up in the Range and purchasing last minute gear. Matt and I were persuaded by the climbing ranger to buy overboots. We for sure needed them, he said, “especially in May.” We already had two-layered “double boots”—boots I wouldn’t use again until/unless I go to Antarctica, the Arctic, or high Himalaya. The overboots added a third layer for possible conditions on Denali—like 40 below with additional wind chill. Even though I read on an online forum that you didn’t necessarily need overboots, we got them anyway. Listen to the climbing ranger or online forum? We chose the 200-dollar toe insurance. We definitely wanted to keep the toes.</p><p>We got our gear sorted and packed in the Sheldon hanger. It was the most gear I’d ever dealt with for a trip by far—about 115 pounds per person. Too much gear it seemed. But we couldn’t throw any of it out because we really didn’t know what we would actually need. We had never done anything like this before. Dave, our pilot, told us we wouldn’t be flying out today. Time to settle in for the night.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-11.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-11.jpeg''/></figure><p>It was clear the next morning. Time to fly in. Dave’s plane was big enough for the three of us, our gear, and Dave. Nothing more. After he strategically loaded our 350 pounds of equipment in the plane, we all hoped in and Dave gave us headphones. We rolled around to the runway and took off. In an instant we rose above the trees, the Alaska range spreading immensely across the horizon—the first time we had seen it clearly. Holy shit it was huge and we were headed right toward it.</p><p>Dave dropped us off on the glacier the next day, a Monday morning, May 2, 2016. It was sunny, but the cold morning air hit us. <em>Shit, it’s cold, and we’re only at basecamp</em>,<em> </em>I thought. The sun warmed the glacier up a bit and after we set up camp we immediately left for the base of the Southwest Ridge of Mt. Frances—our “warm up climb.” We knew that you needed an early start but we left halfway through the day anyway. We were ready to climb. The climb was pretty big—3600 feet—and technical, but we were too excited to sit around. We could always bail, or so we thought.</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-12.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-12.jpeg''/></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-13.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-13.jpeg''/></figure><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-14.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-14.jpeg''/></figure><p>We simul-climbed all the way to the false summit, only 400 vertical feet from the true summit, in seven or eight hours. Matt and I alternated leads six times with Brendon always climbing in the middle. I took most of harder rock portions and Matt took most of the harder snow portions. We simuled right through the 5.7-5.8 mixed rock cruxes pretty easily in our big boots and crampons. We moved fast and it felt good, though the length was beginning to worry me. It was about time to be on top, but the ridge kept going and going until we hit the false summit cornice. Clouds moved in, the visibility diminished, and it started snowing. Moving under the huge cornice—an overhanging mass of hardened snow—I couldn’t help but imagine it collapsing and swiping us off the mountain to the glaciers 3000 feet below.</p><p>I was pretty sure we needed to get around the cornice to the right, but Matt saw a boot track leading up to the left.</p><p>“Are you sure we should go right?” Matt yelled. I thought about it for a second and remembered seeing photos of climbers moving to the right when they reached the cornice, but in my anxiety I questioned myself. Why was there a boot track up to the left?</p><p>“OK, let’s try to the left,” I caved. We traversed across a small ledge above a steep snow slope above a cliff that I couldn’t see the end of. The cornice was overhanging above us. There’s no relief, I thought. I put in my last ice screw and realized I needed more, so I had Brendon and Matt join me on a wider portion of the snow ledge so I could get more gear. Matt was freaking out and wanted to turn around. Brendon and I, more internal compared to Matt, were trying to keep it together.</p><p>“Let me check it out a little farther,” I said. Brendon agreed and Matt was out-numbered. I walked a few steps and peered over an edge. The snow ledge disappeared. We would have to turn directly into the cornice, facing it, and traverse its near vertical ice face to continue.</p><p>“How does it look?” asked Matt.</p><p>“Not good.”</p><p>“Ok, we’re turning around.” Matt turned around and blasted back toward the snow slope.</p><p>“Wait, Matt, you should take these screws and a picket,” I yelled.</p><p>“They won’t do anything.”</p><p>He was probably right, but even suspect protection gave me some peace of mind. Again I was imagining sliding off the mountain. I can’t be doing stuff like this. I thought of Liz and shivered.</p><p>We weren’t going to try going around the cornice to the right. We were done. Our morale was gone. The weather was deteriorating. It was snowing and getting dark. It wasn’t fun anymore. We just wanted to get off safely, even though we were close to the summit. Instead of going back down our route, we down-climbed a 2500-foot couloir and hoped it wouldn’t slide. We stayed rope together so we could find each other if it did. Eventually we were down and back to our tents after 12 hours of non-stop climbing. A nice warm-up, we thought. Welcome to the Alaska Range. Now, onto the real climbing…</p><figure><img src=''/assets/image-asset-15.jpeg'' alt=''image-asset-15.jpeg''/></figure>",
