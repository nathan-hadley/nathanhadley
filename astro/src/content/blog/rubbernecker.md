Excited to share about this special route!

Rubbernecker, South Early Winter Spire, Washington Pass — one of the highest quality routes that I have developed and is also the hardest.

For now I’ll just point to articles I wrote for the American Alpine Club and Rab. The Climbing Magazine article is an interview write-up by [Anthony Walsh](https://www.climbing.com/byline/anthony-walsh/).
