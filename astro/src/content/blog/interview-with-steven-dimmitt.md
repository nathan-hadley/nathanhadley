I had the chance to sit down with Steven Dimmitt to talk about my approach to climbing. Steven started [The Nugget Climbing Podcast](http://thenuggetclimbing.com) earlier this year, and it’s already taken off. He’s a natural at asking thoughtful questions. He sees himself as “the curious person” and wants to share that curiosity through this podcast. I felt like I was able to share what motivates me quite candidly with him. Little do you know that he is also quite a skilled rock climber! Humble dude. Check him out!
