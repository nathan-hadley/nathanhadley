I visited Cuba with my wife, Liz, and brother, Luke, in January. We spent two weeks climbing in the paradise of Viñales. Here are some impressions from our trip to this fascinating country!

_Tobacco farmer. Pretty sure he’s smoking a cigar. This scene felt set up!_

_Cueva Largo. Sport routes ascended both sides of the cave!_
