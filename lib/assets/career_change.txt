<p>Since its inception, this website has reflected the different phases of my life. Initially, it was a professional platform for my photography work. Later, it evolved into a climbing blog, reflecting my lifelong passion and career as a route setter. Most recently, the site underwent a significant transformation. I reconstructed it from scratch using Ruby on Rails. This transformation mirrors my own professional evolution, from route setting to software engineering.</p>

<p>In line with this metamorphosis, I'm launching a new section. Here, I will share my experiences in software engineering, beginning with the tale of my career transition.</p>

<p>My professional journey has been diverse, typically revolving around my love for the outdoors. Earning a degree in environmental science and ecology was an intentional choice, influenced by my aspiration to become an ecologist. Post-graduation, I worked as a restoration ecologist for a year. As I migrated west from Indiana, my path veered towards route setting, thanks to industry connections and my own climbing passion. This journey led me from Indianapolis to Denver and eventually, Seattle.</p>

<p>In 2015, I found myself setting routes at the Seattle Bouldering Project while venturing into outdoor photography. I achieved recognition when National Geographic, The Nature Conservancy, and Backpacker published my photos. However, I discovered photography was not the career I resonated with. Instead, my passion for route setting flourished. I fully committed to this path, joining the management team at the Bouldering Project, and contributing to the advancement of Seattle's route setting program.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, I managed SBP Fremont's route setting program. This role solidified my love for creating climbs and working with a team of creatives. However, I yearned for a new challenge and a career offering more growth opportunities, with the potential for environmental impact.</p>

<p>Fueled by my interest in programming and software design, and recognizing their relevance in today's world, I chose to pursue a post-baccalaureate degree in Computer Science. I was intrigued by the field's potential to address wide-ranging challenges from energy and ecology to climate change.</p>

<p>In route setting, each new climb is a unique puzzle, requiring a meticulous balance of physical and mental challenges for climbers. At first glance, route setting might seem unrelated to software engineering. However, they share a core connection â€“ the necessity for envisioning something yet to be built and the ability to problem-solve, skills fundamental to software engineering.</p>

<p>Juggling my full-time role at SBP, I completed a Computer Science program at Seattle University. This paved the way for a software engineering role at Kithward, a technology startup specializing in the independent living senior living marketplace. Unfortunately, after a year, financial constraints led to the end of my Kithward journey. I've since been exploring fresh opportunities within the software engineering sphere.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my professional path, from environmental science to route setting to software engineering, I realize each shift has been a crucial part of my development. Despite their apparent differences, each field embodies a shared essence - the art of building, problem-solving, and creativity.</p>

<p>My journey from route setting to software engineering has been unexpected yet gratifying. As I continue on this path, I am enthusiastic about harnessing my skills to make a positive difference in the world.</p>
